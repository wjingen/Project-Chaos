0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! A week ago, our country received the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, and today another step has been taken on the path to membership. A very practical step. ""Transport visa-free regime"" was signed. This is an agreement that removes barriers for Ukrainian carriers. You no longer have to wait for permits for freight transportation. And this will significantly increase the export of Ukrainian goods by road transport. This is exactly the task of our state now - not to lose a single week in relations with the European Union. Despite this war, despite all the difficulties, we will constantly do what brings us closer to full membership in the European Union. By the way, yesterday I held a special meeting - a big meeting including 28 participants representing the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. The state will have a relevant document - a clear map of actions that can be checked by any citizen of Ukraine: what needs to be done by state institutions so that we fulfill our part of the job on the path to the European Union. This document will be presented on July 1. I took part in the NATO summit this morning. This is a special summit. A summit of transformation. The Alliance is changing its strategy in response to Russia's aggressive anti-European policies and Russia's war against our country. It is obvious that it is impossible to guarantee security in Europe in such conditions without our state. And we will do everything to transform this obvious nature into concrete decisions - for Ukraine, for the Alliance. We need clear security guarantees - we will have them, and today I called on NATO members to find a format of decisions that would allow for Ukraine's full participation in our common European security architecture. I called on NATO countries to speed up the supply of missile defense systems to Ukraine and significantly increase the pressure on the terrorist state. Today's Russian strike alone at the city of Mykolaiv - 10 missiles at once, and all of them were aimed at civilian targets - proves for absolutely everyone in the world that the pressure on Russia is not enough. One of these missiles, a hypersonic anti-ship missile ""Onyx"", destroyed an ordinary five-story building. Dismantling of the debris continued over the day. As of now, five people are known to have been killed. There were also strikes at Ochakiv, Dnipro, the Russian shelling of the Kharkiv region, Sumy region, Donbas. Lysychansk, Avdiivka, communities in the Bakhmut direction - the situation there remains extremely brutal, very difficult. We are doing everything we can to provide our military with modern artillery systems to respond properly to the occupiers. Russia squeezed out the message of Syria about the alleged recognition of the occupation structures in Donbas as alleged states. This is an empty story. And in that case, there will be no more relations between Ukraine and Syria, and the pressure of sanctions against Syria will be even greater. For the first time in all the years of independence, the President of Indonesia, a very influential state that may suffer significantly from the food crisis provoked by Russia, paid a visit to Kyiv today. Therefore, these were important negotiations that opened for Ukraine another strategic direction of relations with Asia. And another optimistic and very important news: 144 Ukrainian warriors were returned home from Russian captivity. 59 soldiers of the National Guard, 30 - Navy; 28 - army, 17 border guards, 9 territorial defense soldiers, 1 policeman. The oldest of the liberated is 65 years old, the youngest is 19. In particular, 95 Azovstal defenders return home. I am grateful to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and to everyone who worked for this result. But let’s talk about this later. We will do everything to bring every Ukrainian man and woman home. Thank you again. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today at the NATO Summit, which will be crucial and groundbreaking. Today is really the beginning of a new history. Not just for NATO's eastern flank, but for the entire Alliance. For the whole Euro-Atlantic community. In a time of extremely aggressive Kremlin, the world needs an extremely bold Alliance. And I am sure that the next summit in a year will show the results of this summit and what the future of NATO will be. I am grateful once again for this opportunity, and my address to you at the next NATO summit, next year - with my direct participation, not this online format - will be a testament to our common victory. But next year could be a worse situation - if not only Ukraine, but also several other states, possibly members of the Alliance, come under fire from Russia. And then it will be our common failure - Ukraine and NATO. You are all well aware of what Russia's goals really are. For many years it has been threatening to start a war. Threatened - if Ukraine joins NATO. But Ukraine is not in NATO, and Russia's full-scale war against our state has been ongoing for 126 days - after 8 years of war in Donbas. So why has everyone believed for decades that it was NATO that could provoke Russia into something by its actions? Russia's goals are known. They are obvious. The Russian leadership sees the world differently. Not like you. They see Lithuania, for example, not as a member of your Alliance, but as a republic of the Soviet Union. For us, it is an independent state and has long been a former republic of the USSR, for us it is the past, and they see it as a possible future, they want to enslave it again. They consider it that way. They see it that way. And the same goes for every country that is Russia's neighbor. For every state that was once under Moscow's influence. Only now - at this summit - will you identify Russia as your main threat, but you have been an enemy for them for a really long time already. And the ideology of Russia is based on this, it is reflected one hundred percent in its propaganda, its task is to break you, to put pressure on you. And it is surprising that the work of propagandists, Russian television in some of your countries continues! This is not about freedom of speech. This is a concrete preparation of war against you, within your states. And please look at our state - what it can lead to in yours! Russia's tactics are very simple. It destroys everything - houses, shopping malls, schools, hospitals. More than 2,800 missiles since February 24, and the vast majority were aimed at civilian targets! What is it for? What are the bombs for? What are total artillery strikes for? The Russian army is doing everything possible to force as many people as possible to leave their cities. So that there is nothing but ruins. And then the so-called ""second army of the world"" enters these cities - already empty and already dead. And it does not want to stop in Donbas or somewhere in the south of Ukraine, it wants to absorb city after city, all of us, and then all in Europe, whom the Russian leadership considers its property, not independent states. This is Russia's real goal. The question is - who is next for it? Moldova? Or the Baltic countries? Or Poland? The answer is - all of them. The some goes, by the way, with the food crisis - with the blockade of Ukrainian ports, with the famine that Russia is provoking. What is the real target? You! The same! Hunger is a tool, a means. And its real goal is to put pressure on you, and it's chaos, it's new waves of migration to Europe. Isn't that the case with energy? Why is Russia pulling the gas noose? Why is it putting pressure on Europe? For you to ask. For you to be humiliated. For you to be completely dependent. So that you can be forced to give up your freedom, your democracy and your values - for the sake of certain interests of the Russian leadership. We need to see the real goals of Russia. And if they were different, now there would be no desire of Finland and Sweden to join the Alliance - to get common security. Ladies and Gentlemen! While democracies were calling on the Russian leadership to have reason and morality, Russia was accumulating power and missiles. You, the democratic leaders, have urged it to respect international law, but tyrants understand force. And force only! And this is clearly seen in those areas of Ukraine where the Russian army has been severely rebuffed. Ukraine commends the decision on the accession of Finland and Sweden to the Alliance. And it is very good that this has happened now - before Russia could start acting against these states as well. But is Russia doing anything against them now given this decision? No, and you see it. The Russian leadership has publicly stated that the Leningrad streets taught them the rules of life. There, any attempts at dialogue and appeasement are perceived only as weakness and fear. There, you don't make a phone call to anyone to talk when you have to hit back. There, you either hit or lose. This is exactly how the Russian state sees the world right now. And this vision cannot be ignored, its true goals cannot be ignored. You need to answer them. And I'm sure you all know how to respond. In fact, our goals - the goals of Ukraine - are exactly the same as yours. We are interested in security and stability on the European continent and in the world. It is in our interest that the lives of nations are determined not by the infamous Munich speech of one leader, but by international law. We are interested in the absence of any ""gray zones"" and territories of total war, where there is nothing left but ruins. You are also interested in this. Helping Ukraine end this war by winning on the battlefield now - that is, giving a really strong answer to what Russia is doing - is what we and each of your states and the whole Alliance, the whole Euro-Atlantic community need. If you really identify Russia as your threat, your main threat, you must fully support its main - the first - target. This is not a war of Russia only against Ukraine, this is a war for the right to dictate conditions in Europe. For what the future world order will be like. That is why it is absolutely necessary to support Ukraine right now with weapons, finances and political sanctions against Russia that will stop its ability to pay for the war. Ukraine needs modern missile and air defense - and you have these systems. By providing them to us, you can completely break Russia's tactics to destroy cities and terrorize the civilian population of Ukraine. This is a fundamental thing. The distance from Kyiv to Madrid is less than the range of the missiles used against us today. Can one state respond to such a threat without the help of partners? You can provide this help. And we are grateful for the help you have already given. Russia relies primarily on artillery on the battlefield. On artillery superiority. Dozens of times more strikes than we currently can respond with. Ukraine has already received modern artillery systems - and I am very grateful to you. But the war continues and it is a war in which artillery is of great importance. The war should not drag on. To prevent this, we need to break the Russian artillery advantage - a significant advantage, we need much more such modern systems, modern artillery. Financial support for Ukraine is no less important than aid with weapons. Russia still receives billions every day - and spends them on the war. We have a multibillion-dollar deficit - we do not have oil and gas, which could cover it. We need about $ 5 billion a month - you know that, and that's a fundamental thing as well. This is exactly what is needed for defense and protection. And we need a new understanding of NATO's eastern flank. It is possible to get rid of the ""gray zone"" and guarantee security only together with Ukraine. Just think about one fact now: today, a non-NATO country, albeit with your support, has been holding back a state that you all officially identify as your main threat for more than four months. We are deterring Russia from destroying us and from destroying you. Ladies and Gentlemen! Russia must be isolated. It should not be in those international structures it wants to destroy. There should be no dialogues that don't make sense until it starts looking for that dialogue itself. It must seek dialogue itself, itself, and therefore seek peace. And, for the sake of peace, the understanding of NATO's eastern flank must be revised. Is it a coincidence that all Allies in the east, all our neighbors, stand for Ukraine's membership in NATO? No, this is not a coincidence. This is logic. This is the understanding of life in our region. NATO's open door policy should not resemble the old Kyiv metro turnstiles: they are open, and when you approach, the turnstiles close until you pay. Hasn’t Ukraine paid enough yet? Is our contribution to the defense of Europe and the whole civilization still insufficient? What else is needed then? I can say what we need: we need security guarantees, and you have to find a place for Ukraine in the common security space. There will be either urgent help for Ukraine, which is enough to win, or Russia's postponed war with you. You are now adopting the strategy of the Alliance - and this is first and foremost a strategy for the security of your societies, your states. Strategy for ten years. 126 days of full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Cruise missiles, torture, children murdered, women raped... We do not have 10 years. Do you have them? Are you really sure about that? Thanks again for the invitation. Thank you very much for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! I have just taken part in a special meeting of the UN Security Council convened at the request of Ukraine. Convened by Albania - this state presides in the Security Council. We have taken advantage of all international levers to bring Russia to justice for state terrorism. For everything done by the Russian army against Ukrainians in Kremenchuk, in Ochakiv, in Lysychansk, in Kharkiv, in Dnipro, in many, many other cities of Ukraine. As of this evening, the total number of Russian missiles that have hit our cities is already 2,811. And there are many more air bombs, many artillery shells... The UN Security Council today stood in silence to commemorate all Ukrainians killed by the Russian army on our land. The members of the Russian delegation looked at everyone present in the Security Council and also decided to stand up - just so as not to look like outright murderers. But everyone knows that it is Russian terror, it is the Russian state that is killing innocent people in this war waged against the Ukrainian people. I called on the UN to use the existing mechanisms of the Charter to stop Russian manipulation of the Organization's structures and to set up a special tribunal to investigate the actions of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil. Ukraine's law enforcement and intelligence agencies are doing their best to identify all Russian servicemen responsible for the terror against our cities. The names, faces and all information about each of these terrorists will be known to the world. None of them will be able to avoid responsibility, and personal sanctions will not be enough for these people. A sentence and imprisonment are the minimum they deserve. And I wish to say separately about the responsibility of those Russian propagandists who lie about this terror, who are trying to justify the actions of the Russian army. Each of you will also be punished. We have all the evidence of what the Russian troops are doing against our people. Today, I want to end this address with one such piece of evidence - so that no one dares to deceive about the missile strike at the shopping mall in Kremenchuk. The Russian missile hit this very object, purposefully. Obviously, that was the order. It is obvious that Russian assassins received such coordinates for this missile. They wanted to kill as many people as possible in a peaceful city, in a regular shopping mall. Here is what happened in Kremenchuk: (Video) And for this act of state terrorism, as for all others, Russia will be responsible. On the battlefield in Ukraine, by the strengthening of sanctions and, of course, in the tribunal. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 314 more combatants were awarded state awards. Eternal glory to our defenders! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! First of all, I would like to thank the Albanian Presidency of the UN Security Council for convening this meeting promptly - at the request of Ukraine - and for the opportunity to address you. Unfortunately, as of now, the United Nations does not have a legal definition of ""terrorist state"" agreed by all UN member states. But the war that Russia is waging against Ukraine demonstrates not only the meaning of this concept, but also the urgent need to enshrine it legally - at the United Nations level - and to punish any terrorist state. Take a look at the events of just a few days in Ukraine - a few of 125 days of Russia's full-scale war against our state. Saturday, June 25, 62 Russian missiles hit our cities. Sunday, June 26, 10 more missiles. In particular, one of them hit a residential complex in the capital of our state, Kyiv. Three floors of an ordinary house were destroyed. Another missile exploded in the yard of an ordinary kindergarten. Monday, June 27, a missile strike at Kremenchuk. The person who carried out this strike knew for sure that he was aiming a missile at an ordinary shopping center, at one of the many shopping malls that exist in any country in the world. As of now, we know about 18 people killed, but this number may unfortunately increase; more than 50 people were wounded, dozens more are on the missing list. 7 fragments of bodies were found: torn off limbs, arms and legs of people torn off by explosion. And if the Russian state claims that these victims are allegedly not from its missile strike, then I now propose to the United Nations to send either a special representative of the UN Secretary General or a plenipotentiary commission to the site of this terrorist attack in Kremenchuk, so that the UN has an independent opportunity to get all the information and see that this is really a Russian missile strike. Yesterday, the Russian army also struck with MLRS at a queue of people standing to get water. It was in the city of Lysychansk, Luhansk region. Ordinary people, civilians. None of them were military. Just a queue to get water. Eight people were killed, including a 15-year-old boy, his name was Danylo. And the oldest among the dead was 68 years old. And I want you to hear now the names of four women killed by this strike: Viktoriya, Iryna, Olena, Liudmyla. Kharkiv suffers brutal Russian strikes almost every day. Just yesterday 9 people were killed, 29 were wounded, 5 children among them. I want you to know their names: Hlib - 12 years old, Oleh - 8 years old, Mykhailo - 11 years old, Hryhoriy - 9 years old, Artem - 10 years old. It was a Russian artillery strike at ordinary residential buildings. Today at 5 am the Russian army also carried out a strike at Mykolaiv and the city of Ochakiv, Mykolaiv region. Three people were killed in Ochakiv. A 6-year-old girl - her name was Yeva. A man named Mohammed, he was 76 years old. And a woman named Halyna, she was 50 years old. Among the wounded there is a baby, a boy, he is only 3 months old, he was born after the beginning of this full-scale Russian invasion, his name is Volodymyr, and his condition is very grave - now he is in intensive care. I emphasize: a baby. A 3-month-old baby. Two more missiles for today - at the city of Slovyansk - it is in Donbas of our state. In the long-suffering Donbas, which Russia has been tormenting since 2014. Just a few hours before my address to you, to the UN Security Council, two missiles hit the Odesa region. The city of Dnipro was also hit, and one of these missiles destroyed a car service station. Not some military station - the usual car service... And I have a question for you, ladies and gentlemen, who among you does not agree that this is terrorism? If in any part of the world any organization killed any civilians just as Russia kills Ukrainians, it would definitely be recognized as terrorism. Such an organization would become an enemy to all mankind. Therefore, what is punished at the level of specific criminals and criminal organizations must not go unpunished at the level of a state that has become a terrorist. Daily terrorist acts. No days off. They work as terrorists every day. The UN Charter confers on the UN Security Council ""the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security."" Article 6 of Chapter II of the UN Charter clearly states that ""A Member of the United Nations who has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council."" Although Russia is violating the fundamental principles of the United Nations and the international legal order, it has not yet been held to account at the global level. It still remains in the UN agencies and even enjoys the privileges of the seat it occupies, the seat of the permanent member of the UN Security Council, which Russia occupies solely due to the short-sightedness of the politicians at the end of the Cold War. Russia has no right to take part in discussing and voting in regard to the war against Ukraine, which is unprovoked and simply colonialist on the part of Russia. I urge you to deprive the delegation of a terrorist state of its powers in the UN General Assembly, and that is possible. That is necessary. That's right! That's fair! Russia has no right to remain in the UN Security Council. And this path is not as thorny, as someone may believe, if you show consistency and proper political will. This is the only logical way for the UN Charter to work and be respected by all members of the Organization. Furthermore, our Organization already has enough power to bring a terrorist state to justice. Chapter VII of the UN Charter allows for the establishment of a special international tribunal to investigate the actions of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil. The word ""genocide"" has repeatedly been used. And you all saw what the Russian occupiers did in our city of Bucha. Each of you can obtain information on how many mass graves appeared around the city of Mariupol alone after the Russian army razed it to the ground. It was a city of half a million residents! Now there are ruins. In the case of the genocide in Rwanda, the UN Security Council established an International Tribunal within six months since the beginning of the genocide. More than four months have passed since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. It has been 8 years since the beginning of Russia's war against Ukraine in Donbas and the occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, which has been repeatedly condemned at the level of the UN General Assembly. We need to act immediately - and do everything to make Russia stop the killings of children, people - everyone. It must be brought to justice for terrorism, otherwise it could bring terrorist activity to other European countries, Asia - the Baltic states, Poland, Moldova, Kazakhstan - many nations have already heard threats from Russian officials and state propagandists. I am grateful to all the diligent and civilized states who share our position and help defend the international legal order. This meeting of the UN Security Council was convened after the Russian missile strike at Kremenchuk. But in fact, the meeting of the UN Security Council may not be interrupted at all and go on round the clock day after day to have time to discuss every terrorist act of the Russian state. The UN Charter gives all the levers to influence any violator of the rules of the Organization, any aggressor, any terrorist state. And I urge you to use these levers. It is imperative to deprive the Russian delegation of the opportunity to manipulate the UN. It is imperative to make it impossible for Russia to stay in the UN Security Council until its terrorism continues. It is imperative to establish a tribunal to investigate everything that the Russian troops have done against Ukrainians. And it is imperative to give a legal definition of the notion ""state terrorism"" at the UN level. All Russia's actions must receive a legal assessment - global sanctions for destroying the international legal order. Thank you for your attention and I wish to say just one more thing. Various countries of the world may have different attitudes to war, to any war. But in every country of the world, the memory of the deceased is equally honored. Not just the military, but every person, every child who dies in a tragedy of war. That is the usual thing. People treat with respect and compassion those perished and whose lives were unjustly taken away. Only the killers do not honor the memory of those they killed. And I ask you now - I will be grateful to you - to honor the memory of all Ukrainians who have been killed in this war. All the adults, all our children. Tens of thousands of people. I ask you to commemorate them with a moment of silence. Thank you.  ",1576,0.192,0.715,0.093,-0.9998,29 June 2022  - 00:00 ,29 June 2022,1,"It is necessary that Russia stops killing people, it is necessary to bring it to justice for terrorism - speech by the President of Ukraine at the meeting of the UN Security Council",2022,June,29,"It is necessary that Russia stops killing people, it is necessary to bring it to justice for terrorism - speech by the President of Ukraine at the meeting of the UN Security Council - 29 June 2022  - 00:00 ",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/potribno-shob-rosiya-pripinila-vbivati-lyudej-potribno-prity-76109,2022-06-29,6
0,"Dear Ukrainians! Unbreakable citizens of an unbreakable country! Great people with a great history! Conscientious society of the state guided by the rule of law! The fact that all of the above is true is proved by many things. Ancient documents and chronicles, historical and legal landmarks, religious traditions and folk customs, science, literature, music, painting, legends and myths, proverbs and sayings, and even news releases. All this in its own way depicts our state and all of us. But there is one thing that, in my opinion, gives the most detailed and objective assessment. This is the Constitution of Ukraine! This is a point of development that we have reached as a state and society over the centuries of history. The government system is our intellect. The form of government shows whether we have moved to the next level of civilization or are stuck in an era of tyranny and dictatorship. The Constitution, like an X-ray, shows our strengths and weaknesses. Our principles, our values, our ideals. The level of freedom and rights that we are willing to defend. The level of maturity and responsibilities we are willing to fulfill. The norms of the Constitution make it possible to decipher the genetic code of our nation. Find the answer to two main questions: what is Ukraine and who are the Ukrainians? This is our detailed portrait. And especially now, during a full-scale war, its main features are clearly visible. We passed the Basic Law of the state 26 years ago. 26 years later, defending our state is the basic law for us. Why? The answer is in the preamble of the Constitution. The principles of its adoption 26 years ago are the principles of our struggle now. They explain why and what we are fighting for. This is the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination, the universally approved independence of Ukraine, the irreversibility of the path to Europe. This is the responsibility to God, to one's own conscience, to previous, present, and future generations. We didn't start the war, we were not the first to shoot and we were not the first to attack. We defend Ukraine, which is a sovereign, independent, democratic, social and legal state. Taking up arms, we did not hesitate, as at a crossroads. We did not choose whether to defend the first article of the Constitution or to adhere to the first commandment of God. God is on our side, he says that defending your home from evil is not a sin. It is a sin not to defend it. Our sovereignty extends to the entire territory. We are a unitary state. Our territory within the existing borders is integral and inviolable. That is why in the east and west, in the south, in the north and in the center, our people are heroically fighting for these principles and for the second article of our Constitution. Repelling the second army of the world. Which is indifferent to all the threats and risks of World War III. But we are not indifferent to the norms of the third article of the Constitution. A person, a person's life and health, honor and dignity, inviolability and security are the highest social values. And our people are defending this principle at the cost of their lives, health and security. With honor and dignity! The norm for us is to protect it. The norm for us is to protect other norms. Land is the main national wealth. Its subsoil, air, water and other natural resources of its territory, continental shelf and sea zone are the property of the Ukrainian people. We will fight for every meter of our land to the last breath. Because only the people can change the constitutional order in Ukraine. No one can usurp state power. We know the term ""democracy"" well, so we don't know what the fifth term is. Our right to protest, assembly and manifestation is a constitutional article, and for others it is a criminal one. State symbols are not symbolic or formal for us. Our state flag is a flag made of blue and yellow stripes. Two sacred colors. The third is not given. As it is not allowed for a foreign tricolor to hoist over our land, in our sky in any way different than with the prefix ""temporarily"". Our coat of arms is a sign of the Princely State of Volodymyr the Great. This is a trident. Not two-headed birds. Because this is not going to fly here. Our National Anthem ""The glory and freedom of Ukraine has not yet perished…"" They live and will live on. Our people in the occupied cities are not afraid to go to peaceful rallies and sing their anthem. Sing out loud. Looking into the eyes of the occupier, sing that they will vanish like the dew in the sun. This nation cannot be defeated! Only exterminated. But even this is impossible. Because we are of Cossack descent! And our state language is Ukrainian. And we respect all other languages. We do not oppress any of them. That is why today people are fighting for Ukraine in Ukrainian, Crimean Tatar, Polish, Russian, Belarusian, Moldovan, Hungarian, Romanian, Georgian and many other languages! Because it is clear without words what evil is. And you can beat it without words. The occupier expected a warm welcome, but faced fierce resistance. Meeting not with bread and salt, but with ""Stugna"" and ""Javelin"", ""Bayraktar"" and ""Neptune"", ""Vilkha"" and ""HIMARS"". Our resistance has lasted for 125 days already. For the world it is the eighth miracle, for the enemy it is the ninth wave, and for us it is the seventeenth article of the Constitution of Ukraine. The defense of Ukraine is the most important function of the state and the matter of the entire Ukrainian people. We have no choice but to defend our choice. It is our obligation to protect our rights. Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. An inalienable right to life that Russia has violated tens of thousands of times and claimed tens of thousands of lives. It is the inviolability of home, which is violated every day and night by its missiles, bombs and bullets. These are rights that are familiar and inalienable to us. This is freedom of speech. That is why Ukrainians are not afraid to tell the enemy ""go home."" Because they have freedom of thought. They know how to think, see, hear, understand, distinguish truth from lies. This is the right to vote and to be elected. Impossibility to be arrested for nothing. Freedom of movement. Immunity. These are all children's rights. We are fighting for all this today. To defend, liberate and restore. For our future generations to have rights, our generation has no right to give up. We do not have such a desire either. The enemy will not be able to realize the force with which we are ready to fight for our rights and freedoms. He who does not have it himself will never deprive others of it. That is why victory is inevitable for us. Punishment is inevitable for the enemy. And it will come. And peace will come, too. And our children will finally go to school. They know from an early age what freedom and struggle for it are, what rights are, what the Constitution of Ukraine is. And they know what glorious legal ancestors they have. In particular, the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk, which is over 300 years old. It is called the first written Constitution of Europe. And last year it visited home, Ukraine, for the first time. It was exhibited in Kyiv, but it is fair to read it in every corner of Ukraine. To this end, it will be translated from Latin into Ukrainian, and tens of thousands of copies will be sent to Ukrainian schools! We are sure that sooner or later the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk, the Constitution of independent Ukraine, and other subjects of the Ukrainian school will be studied by our happy and smiling children - in Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Kherson, Crimea! Victory is not far off! Victory will be ours! Happy Constitution Day of Ukraine, dear citizens! Glory to you! Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"This address is without greetings. Today's Russian strike at a shopping mall in Kremenchuk is one of the most defiant terrorist attacks in European history. A peaceful city, an ordinary shopping mall with women, children, ordinary civilians inside... Before the air alarm there were about a thousand people. Fortunately, as far as we know at this time, many people managed to get out in time. They were taken out in time. But there were still people inside: staff, some visitors... Only totally insane terrorists, who should have no place on earth, can strike missiles at such an object. And this is not an off-target missile strike, this is a calculated Russian strike - exactly at this shopping mall. It is not yet possible to establish the number of victims for now. A fire broke out in an area of more than 10 thousand square meters. The rescue operation continues, but we must be aware that the losses may be significant. As of now, we know about 12 dead and 24 wounded. We are establishing the number of people under the rubble. All the wounded will be provided with all the necessary assistance - Kyiv doctors have already left for Kremenchuk. The Minister of Internal Affairs is already there, he will coordinate all the necessary actions. My condolences to the families and friends of those killed in this terrible terrorist attack. And I ask each and every one - whenever you hear the air alarm siren, go to the shelter. Necessarily. Don't ignore it. Russia will stop at nothing. This morning, I appealed to the United States to recognize Russia as a state that sponsors terrorism. The relevant resolution is approved by the US Senate Committee, and the legal decision can be adopted by the Department of State. And such a decision is clearly needed, and it must be supported by the entire democratic world. I told this to the participants of the G7 Summit, which took place in Germany. As of today, Russia has used almost 2,800 different cruise missiles against Ukraine. The number of air bombs and MLRS rockets hitting our cities simply cannot be counted. There were hundreds of thousands of them in the four months of the war. This is nothing but terror. Another brutal shelling of Kharkiv, northern Saltivka took place today. At present, we know about 5 people killed and more than 30 wounded, 5 of them children. All are civilians, no military. The Russian state has become the largest terrorist organization in the world. And this is a fact. And this must be a legal fact. And everyone in the world must know that buying or transporting Russian oil, maintaining contacts with Russian banks, paying taxes and customs duties to the Russian state means giving money to terrorists. I also said today, addressing the leaders of the G7, that our common potential is absolutely enough to defeat the Russian army - it does not know how to fight. All the operations we carry out to deoccupy our territories show one thing: the occupiers are crumbling when we have something to put pressure on them. They do not know how to resist. They are capable only of such vile strikes as those in Kremenchuk or Saltivka today, only of the total thoughtless destruction of all living things as in Mariupol. Therefore, the war may not drag on, if we can really push together and drive the occupiers out of our Ukrainian land. The sooner this happens, the more lives will be saved. Even before the start of a full-scale war, we told our partners that we needed modern missile defense. We repeated this after February 24 as well. People in the Kremenchuk shopping mall deserved security just as much as people in any mall in the world - somewhere in Philadelphia or Tel Aviv, or in a shopping gallery somewhere in Dresden. The world can, and therefore must, stop Russian terror. And now I can already say this - I heard it from our partners: Ukraine must get reliable missile defense, we are expecting the supply of appropriate systems. And there is another important result of the ""seven"", which is worth mentioning right now. This has already been officially agreed: the most powerful democracies in the world will support our state as long as necessary for our victory. Ukraine will not be broken! Never. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Unbreakable people of an unbreakable country! Russia today again hit Kyiv with missiles. Early in the morning. The second army of the world triumphantly ""defeated"" a kindergarten and an apartment building. The man died, he was only 37 years old. There are wounded, among them - a girl named Zhenya, she is seven years old, the daughter of the deceased, now she is in ""Okhmatdyt"". Her mother was also wounded. By the way, a citizen of Russia. That’s that. She was not threatened by anything in our country, she was completely safe, until Russia itself decided that everything was equally hostile to them now - women, children, kindergartens, apartment buildings, hospitals, railways. Missiles also hit the Mykolaiv region, the Chernihiv region, Odesa, Cherkasy. Artillery and mortar shelling did not stop in the Kharkiv region, in the Sumy region, in Donbas, in the south of our state. My condolences to the families and friends of the victims. Everyone who was injured is given all the necessary help. Part of the missiles were shot down. But only part. We need a powerful air defense - modern, fully effective. Which can ensure complete protection against these missiles. We talk about this every day with our partners. There are already some agreements. And partners need to move faster if they are really partners, not observers. Delays in the transfer of weapons to our state, any restrictions are actually an invitation for Russia to strike again and again. The occupiers - these terrorists - must be beaten with all our might so that they do not think they can put pressure and outplay someone. What are these missiles about today? And what are yesterday's 62 missiles - for only one Saturday, for 24 hours - are about? They are about the Russian method: to escalate every time international events take place. And at the same time they are about determination. About, for example, the fact that the leaders of the G7, who gathered in Germany today for a summit, have enough common potential to stop Russian aggression against Ukraine and against Europe as a whole. It is possible. But this is possible only if we get everything we ask for, and just in time we need it - weapons, financial support, and sanctions against Russia. It cannot be otherwise in this war. Because it is here - in the sky over Kyiv, in the sea near Odesa, on the land of the Kharkiv region, Donbas, in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions - that it is being decided what life will be like in Europe in the future. Here, in Ukraine, and nowhere else. Of course, there are not as many missiles in Russia as we have confidence in ourselves. But Russian weapons can be stopped only by more powerful weapons. I spoke about this today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau - how else we can strengthen defense support for Ukraine and how else we can increase the pressure of sanctions on Russia. I thanked Justin for the help already provided - one of the most tangible. And today I want to say a few more things, very targeted. Firstly, all pilots, dispatchers, mechanics and other people who ensure the launch of missiles at Ukraine must understand: we will find you all. Each of you will be responsible for these strikes. And if someone thinks that he will evade responsibility by saying that such was the order, you are mistaken. When your missiles hit residential buildings, these are war crimes. Trial is what awaits you all. And there will be nowhere to hide for you - neither on the shores of the Caspian Sea, over which your missiles are launched, nor in Belarus... Nowhere. And I would like to separately address the citizens of Belarus today. Both civilians and those in uniform. You are being drawn into the war. And even more actively than in February and in the spring months. The Kremlin has already decided everything for you - your lives are worth nothing to them. But you are not slaves or cannon fodder. You do not have to die. And you can prevent anyone from deciding for you what awaits you next. I know that the people of Belarus support Ukraine, they support us, definitely us, not the war. And that is why the Russian leadership wants to draw you - all Belarusians - into the war, wants to sow hatred between us. A lot now depends on the ordinary people of Belarus. And I know that you can refuse to participate in this war. Your lives belong only to you, not to someone in the Kremlin. Ukraine will defend itself from strikes from any direction and from any weapon. I'm sure we will endure and get everything back. But anyone, any normal person in any country, in particular in Belarus, can contribute to the protection of life. This week will be very important for all of us. Therefore, we continue to work at all levels and do not slow down. Glory to all who defend the state! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! 45 Russian missiles over the night and morning of today. Zhytomyr region, Lviv region, Chernihiv region, Mykolaiv. In the evening - more missiles. Different types, different launch areas... All of them were launched with one goal - to show that Russia allegedly can achieve something, that the Russian army will allegedly succeed. Today marks the fifth month of a full-scale war. The occupiers were going to capture most of our country on the fifth day, but have to stage such a missile show on the fifth month, which does not change anything strategically for Russia. This is such a phase of the war - morally difficult, emotionally difficult. When we know that the enemy will not succeed, when we understand that we will still be able to defend our state, but we do not feel the time limits of this, we do not feel how many more strikes, losses, efforts will be before we see that victory is already on our horizon. For this, Russia needs these missile strikes at cities across the country, artillery and mortar shelling of the border areas of our state, the border areas of the Chernihiv, Sumy regions, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk region. It is not just the destruction of our infrastructure, it is also a very cynical, calculated pressure on the emotions of our people. But it's not us who will be overpowered, we will overpower them. No Russian missiles, no strikes can break the morale of Ukrainians. And each of their missiles is an argument in our negotiations with partners. I will take part in the G7 Summit on Monday. The NATO Summit will take place next week. 45 missiles in half a day and just on the eve of such meetings. All clear. Another confirmation of our position. This confirms that sanctions packages against Russia are not enough, that Ukraine needs more armed assistance, and that air defense systems - the modern systems that our partners have - should be not in training areas or storage facilities, but in Ukraine, where they are now needed. Needed more than anywhere else in the world. And one more thing that should be said today after such a missile attack. In the four months of the war, more than 20,000 Ukrainian warriors were awarded state awards. More precisely, 20,463. These are the Armed Forces, the National Guard, border guards, our rescuers, police, intelligence, Security Service, our doctors, State Security Administration, State Special Communications Service, NABU special forces, State Bureau of Investigation and employees of the Judicial Security Service... 156 warriors were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. This is the scale of courage, this is the level of resistance. And if there are more than 20 thousand of those whose feat has already been awarded, what kind of missiles can anyone in Russia hope for? What artillery, what mines can help the occupiers, if they are really opposed by mass people’s resistance? Therefore, all our cities: Severodonetsk, Donetsk, Luhansk - we will return everything. Every week we go to Kherson. Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar and Mariupol were never forgotten. And all other cities of Ukraine that are temporarily occupied will be Ukrainian only. Thanks to our heroes, thanks to each and everyone who does not get tired, who does not succumb to emotional breakdowns, who struggles and who knows that victory is ahead. Our victory, only ours. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Good evening, great people of our state! Today was marked by a discussion of the historic decision of the EU Summit - granting Ukraine candidate status. Since this morning and until this moment, there is a dialogue on television, radio, on the Internet about what it means, what conditions Ukraine has to fulfill, how difficult it will be to fulfill and how many years it will take… And I want to say the following on this day. Let's rejoice at least a little. In a quiet, modest way, silently, but rejoice. For ourselves, for our beloved state. Let's feel the moment and the taste of this moment. Imagine conquering Everest. You reached the penultimate point. You didn't look around, didn't even take a breath and talk about the further way to the top. How difficult it will be to overcome the last 1848 meters. Instantly we forgot and devalued our own success. Maybe we should first recall that we have already covered 7,000 meters?! Let’s not be ashamed to talk about our achievements. Let’s not be a nation with a short memory and inferiority complex. We say: Ukraine has been granted EU candidate status. Let's say: Ukraine has gained EU candidate status. Did it fall from the sky? Haven’t we endured and done a lot? Today we focus on seven EU requirements. Yes. It's true. But does it scare us? No. Because before that we successfully fulfilled hundreds. Let's not forget about it. Not for bragging, but for the belief that we will definitely overcome this path. We have covered 7,000 meters, so we will not stop - we will reach our Everest. Let's talk at least for a moment not about what awaits us, but about what we managed to do. Because, forgetting about it, we underestimate the significance of this step. There were times when we couldn't take tickets in the evening and fly to Europe in the morning. We stood in line. Documents, visas, etc. Remember? A pile of papers that we carried in the file, which were required by all government agencies with officials who did not report to us and did not submit electronic declarations. High-ranking officials, for the control of which there was neither a special body nor a special court. Deputies with immunity. President who could not be impeached. Land that could not just be bought. Sounds wild? It seems it wasn't with us, doesn’t it? It was. And not so long ago. But we changed everything. Privatization. Land reform. Open-list voting. Decentralization. NACP, Anticorruption Court, administrative services centers, public services online. Diia. Split. Unbundling. Concession. Common aviation space. Industrial visa-free regime. Deoligarchization. Much has been done. Exactly done! Let's not forget that. Let's be proud of ourselves. Respect ourselves. And we repelled the Russians. And we will win. Because when we respect ourselves we will be respected by others. Do not rejoice at a slap in the face of Moscow, but be proud of applause for Ukraine. And that's why I want to see us in one family. Let it inspire you. We deserved it. Realized it. Smile, please. And may God give us all a quiet night. Well, tomorrow is the battle again. With new strength. With new wings. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Fellow citizens of Ukraine! Dear Ukrainian people! 120 days ago, Russia launched a full-scale war against us. For 120 days, Ukraine and its people have heroically been defending their land and their freedom. They are fighting back one of the largest armies in the world. The aggressor, whose population is three times larger than ours, and the area is almost 30 times bigger. Therefore, each of the 120 days of our struggle is historic. But this day is special. Ukraine has officially received the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. We have heard many statements from many politicians over the years about the course to Europe and the strategic importance of this course. We are not politicians, and we do not have many years, so we have moved from statements to action. From dreams to action. And on February 28, Ukraine applied for EU membership. On Bankova Street, in the Office of the President of Ukraine, in the middle of fortifications and sandbags, in the pauses between the sirens of the air alarm, we signed a document. Many people were skeptical, and considered Ukraine's chances illusory. But we all united. Ukraine united. And the world saw our unique feature: the less they believe in us, the better we perform. Instead of thousands of words, thousands of slogans about moving to the EU, we filled in thousands of pages of the European Commission's questionnaire. What other countries spend a few years doing, we did in a few weeks. At the summit in Brussels, the leaders of the 27 EU member states adopted an official decision: Ukraine receives the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. And today I want to give a series of answers honestly, clearly and comprehensively for everyone. Fill in our questionnaire. Explain in human language what exactly happened and why it is so important. What does this mean for us and what does this mean for Ukraine? What does this mean and what does it give to Europe? What next? What will we do? What do our partners expect from us? What do we expect from partners? What do we expect from you as a society? And why will we definitely succeed? First, candidate status is not just a new step. This is a new summit. Not a new paragraph, not a new page or even a new section. This is a new volume in the history of Ukraine's European integration, which we started writing today. And as of today, this book has no other options but one: Ukraine will become a member of the EU in the future. As of today, this is fixed at the official level. Candidate status is a mandatory step that most countries have gone through. This is a point of no return. It's not just a new name or a new sign. This is a new status and a new image. Today it is recognized: Ukraine is not a bridge, not a pillow between the West and Russia, not a buffer between Europe and Asia, not a sphere of influence, not a ""gray"" zone, not a transit territory. Not the border between orcs and elves. Ukraine is a future equal partner for at least 27 EU countries. Chairman of The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk: EU candidate status is a recognition of our achievements in becoming a mature democratic European society. The strengths of our institutions that continue to work effectively even in times of full-scale war. This is a powerful political message. It will be heard by soldiers in the trenches, every family that was forced to flee the war abroad, everyone who helps bring our victory closer. But it will also be heard in the bunker. We can't change geography. Russia will continue to be our neighbor. But that decision has changed history. And in this case, history has defeated geography. Behind us is a column of Magdeburg law. It was installed in the place where Volodymyr the Great christened Kyivan Rus’-Ukraine. Hundreds of years later, this column was fortified with protective shields against Russian bullets and shells. It is an eloquent symbol of how they want to destroy our culture, our faith, our law. Our history. But history will win. The future will win. Ukraine will win. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal: Candidate status is a high evaluation of the market transformations that have enabled us to integrate into the EU economy in the energy, digital, customs, transport and other key sectors. These are new perspectives and new opportunities for Ukraine. Access to new EU financial support programs. These are new investments, new projects, new jobs, and support for post-war reconstruction. From now on, our state not only will adopt the European experience, but also will be able to influence the formation of sectoral policies of the European Union. From now on, the process of Ukraine's integration into the EU has become irreversible. From now on, Ukraine has a legal place in the European family. And relations between us and the EU are moving from the neighborhood policy to the enlargement policy. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Even simpler. In the plane of not political, but human relations. Obtaining candidate status is an engagement. A serious step in the relations between Ukraine and the EU. This is not just friendship, not sympathy, but a firm and official intention to become one in the future. In the near future. And as of today, Ukraine will be able to join the work of certain bodies and new EU programs, access to which is limited to third countries. Today we have got rid of this humiliating definition. Ukraine has never been like that in essence, but the official terminology called us that. We got rid of it. We are not a third country. Not a tenth, not a hundredth, we are a future member of the European Union. Today is an important day. We hear the Ode to Joy. Joy, but not euphoria. There is a lot of work ahead. The work of everyone in their place. The cohesion of all branches of government and society is our key to success. Despite the war, we continue to implement EU legislation, norms and rules in all spheres of life. The government will develop an appropriate roadmap. The next steps are known - we have the recommendations of the European Commission. We expect the Verkhovna Rada to approve European integration laws as a matter of priority. We expect all of you to have high civic consciousness, devotion to our values and awareness that no one will build us a European Ukraine, except us. I would like to emphasize a very important point. We are changing Ukraine for ourselves, not for someone else. We are implementing reforms not because of someone's demands, but because of our own beliefs. Ukraine seeks not to join, but to return to the European family. In 2014, the Ukrainian people withstood and defended its European future. But it has chosen it much earlier. Because democracy existed here more than a thousand years ago. In the days of Kyivan Rus’, when people joined in solving important issues in veche. Human rights, human life have already been valued a thousand years ago. Kyivan Rus’ is probably the only medieval state where there was no death penalty. 700 years ago there was a widespread legal system of local self-government. 700 years ago Ukrainian cities already had the Magdeburg law. Historians say that the borders of Europe are the outskirts of the last eastern city, which has the Magdeburg law. It did not take root further than the east of Ukraine. 500 years ago, our ancestors chose their own leaders. Hetmans of Zaporizhzhia and Kish otamans were not appointed by the king, tsar, boyars, nobility or aristocracy, but were elected freely and equally by all Cossacks. For centuries, our people have been committed to the principles of tolerance and respect. Hundreds of national communities and representatives of all religious denominations have lived and still live in peace and harmony on our land. Today Ukraine is fighting for its freedom. And this war began just when Ukraine declared its right to freedom. To its choice of its future. We saw it in the European Union. No matter how someone convinced us that no one wanted us there and a happy tomorrow for Ukraine was possible in a completely different union called Customs. And no matter how surprised they were that Ukrainians prefered freedom over cheap gas. We have chosen the path. The path determined by our people, not someone's power. Chosen by Maidan Nezalezhnosti, not Red Square. The path the Revolution on Granite fought for in 1990, the Orange Revolution stood on barricades for in 2004 and the Heavenly Hundred gave lives for during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. It was then that the voice of Ukraine sounded loudest. It was there that we firmly chose our path. That is why the Russian Federation appeared on it, annexing Crimea, occupying part of Donbas and later starting a full-scale war against the whole of Ukraine. And that is why this decision of the EU is so important, motivates us and shows: all this is needed not only by us. Having declared our desire to go to the EU, today we finally heard clearly: we are waiting for you! You are welcome! We want to see you as a full member of our family. Hence, all this was not in vain. And our struggle continues not in vain. Ukraine has truly united. Ukraine is truly fighting. Ukraine will definitely win. Truly! Ukraine. Europe. World. Humanity.

All of us together: Ukraine, your states and the European Union as a whole. This path is not politics. I believe this is what will always be the starting point of Europe's new history. Europe without division. Europe without ""gray"" zones. Europe that is truly united and that knows how to defend itself, its values, its future. Today you have adopted one of the most important decisions for Ukraine in all 30 years of independence of our state. However, I believe this decision is not only for Ukraine. This is the biggest step towards strengthening Europe that could be taken right now, in our time and in such difficult conditions, when the Russian war is testing our ability to preserve freedom and unity. On the fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, we applied to join the European Union. We provided extremely fast and high-quality answers to the questionnaire we received from the European Commission. And here is the desired result today. Today, I would like to reaffirm that Ukraine is capable of becoming a full-fledged member of the European Union. Then, three months ago, I addressed each country of the European Union and indicated at what stage we were, as I thought, in our relations. And today I would like to tell each and every one of you personally what our people feel, and in the same order as it was then. France stands for us. Thank you, Emmanuel! You can be sure that with Ukraine, Europe will really be able to be among the global leaders in the XXI century. Germany stands for us. Thank you, Olaf! Thank you for your support at a crucial moment. I have always said that we, Ukrainians, believe in the European Union. Although we remained formally outside the European Union, our country probably had the largest number of flags of a united Europe. They were in the hands of our people during the revolutions. They have been in the hands of our people in the trenches since 2014. I believe that the flag of the European Union will be in every Ukrainian city that we have yet to liberate from the occupation of the Russian Federation. Ukrainian and European flags will also be together when we will be rebuilding our state after this war together. And today in the framework of our joint meeting – the summit of all European leaders, I would like to express special gratitude to our heroes - each and everyone who defends the independence of Ukraine with weapons in their hands, defends the freedom of Europe. Thank you! Thank you for making possible a new history of Ukraine, a new history of Europe - even stronger, even freer. Thank you all so much! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear students! Dear lecturers! Dear attendees! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful for this opportunity. It is an honor for me to address you today. You know, to be honest, I have inquiries - a lot of them - from Israel, in particular from journalists. And I very often disagree. And not just me, frankly speaking. I love your country very much, so I will be honest. I reject these inquiries because, to be honest, sometimes I don't know what to say to people. I have often been to Israel, and it is sometimes difficult for me to respond to such inquiries. Why? I think you will understand me when you hear my address. And I think you will draw your own conclusions. You are smart and independent people. So, if it wasn’t for the war, I could visit your wonderful university and talk to you directly with pleasure. But since the beginning of the full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022, I remain in Ukraine, in our capital, in Kyiv. The Office of the President of Ukraine is located in the heart of the city. And if you visit Kyiv, you will definitely come here as well. Also, I'm sure you will visit some other places in our capital, in our country. If you walk literally 5 minutes down the street from the building where I am now, you will reach the street where the house of Golda Meir’s family was located - one of the most famous, great Israeli women in the world. She was born in Kyiv. I think you know that. Kyiv, like many other cities and communities in Ukraine, is full of such places. Places of remembrance for both Ukrainian and Jewish nations. Places that connect us - and it's not just historical. It's not just plain facts. It is a space of real life of real people, which has forever united our cultures. This is the life in which there is one of the founders of the State of Israel Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and Waldemar Haffkine - one of the most remarkable scientists in human history, who created the first vaccines against plague and cholera. These are the great musician Vladimir Horowitz and the great physicist Abram Joffe. This is Vladimir Jabotinsky, whose mind was so interesting and whose life was so important that his publications are still read today; and this is Natan Sharansky, a politician of the time closer to us, whom we all know well, I personally know him, we all know in both our countries. Of course, these are places of faith without which it is impossible to imagine your culture. In particular, in our city of Uman, which annually received tens of thousands of Hasidic pilgrims. Or in Medzhybizh, where Baal Shem Tov is buried. Of course, these are places of sorrow that all mankind must remember and not forget. The Babyn Yar – a symbol of the Holocaust from bullets, the Drobytsky Yar and other such places on the land of then occupied Ukraine, where the Nazis killed innocent people. We remember all this, we preserve all this. And all this is now under threat. Because how can the places of remembrance be preserved in a total war for the destruction of everything living? Tomorrow, June 24, it will be four months since Russia has launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. And I am sure that each and every one of you has seen that this is a tragedy, has seen what kind of war it is at all, and how Russia is waging it. It destroys our cities. It totally burns down everything in the way of the Russian army or devastates the occupied territories. The main Russian weapons are artillery, air bombs, and cruise missiles. The occupiers do not try to think how to fight. Their tactics are very primitive. They use the maximum of bomb and artillery capabilities so that there is simply nowhere to resist. The Russian army fires missiles at Ukraine every day and every night. The vast majority of them are aimed at ordinary non-military facilities - residential buildings, enterprises, infrastructure, civilians. As of this morning, 2,709 missiles have already been used against Ukraine. And given the pace of their use, very soon the total number will reach 3,000 missiles. These are not unsophisticated missiles. Yes, there are obsolete, Soviet missiles among them, even those of the 1960s. But there are also modern ones. However, there is no selectivity in strikes for Russian missiles, bombs and artillery. That is why, for example, the Menorah in the Drobytsky Yar, which stands there in memory of the Holocaust victims, was also damaged by Russian shelling. They even fired at the Menorah! And should I tell you how many educational facilities the Russian army destroyed in Ukraine? Now you are in one of the wonderful universities, but it is one university - it is very good, but it is one. And imagine 2,000 destroyed educational institutions. How many people are there? Two thousand institutions! Who do you have to be to strike at a university, school or kindergarten with artillery? Russia has become a terrorist state. That's it. I'm sure you all know what the Russian army did to our city of Mariupol. In fact, this city no longer exists. And just four months ago, half a million people lived there. Now there are tens of thousands left in the scorched ruins. And they are threatened by infections that are simply impossible to imagine in today's world. In particular, an infection of cholera that Waldemar Haffkine fought against a hundred years ago. Mariupol is a city where now, week after week, the Russian occupiers are hiding traces of crimes, burying the remains of murdered people in mass graves. The Russian army did the same to Volnovakha and dozens of other towns and villages in Ukraine. And what is happening in the territories where the occupiers managed to enter quickly? Civilians are executed there, refugees are killed on the roads. People are tortured there. People are raped there, including minors - both girls and boys. The Russian troops have set up ""filtration camps"" in which people are tormented. Thousands were killed or mutilated in such camps. The occupiers carry out deportation of Ukrainians to Russia, scattering them in remote regions. And only a few manage to return to Ukraine through the territory of third countries. The number of forcibly displaced persons in our country in just four months is more than 12 million people. 12 million people! Nowhere in Europe in 77 years since World War II has there been anything similar to what Russia has done. Well, tell me how is it possible not to help the victim of such aggression? I ask you this question because I know that you do care, as well as millions, tens, hundreds of millions of people on our planet. So, I will return to where I started my address, to why I rarely, really rarely communicate with journalists when there are inquiries from Israel. I think you will understand. It's difficult for me. I do not know what to say to these distinguished persons. I do not know how to answer the questions I often hear. The questions: what help did Israel provide? And how else can we help? All journalists from all countries ask such questions. I just don't know what to say. Of course, I am grateful to the people of Israel, I am grateful to you for the sincere and emotional support for Ukrainians. I am grateful for all the Ukrainian flags that appeared on your streets - we see it all, we appreciate it all. For all the words that sounded in our support in your society. I am grateful to your great people. But we would like to get support from your government. It seems fair to me. For example, the geographically small state of Luxembourg, with a population of around 600,000, has provided us with defense support in the amount of 15% of its defense budget. The Baltic states - small, neighboring states - provided significant help when they sent us the necessary weapons. Maybe it was not much, but they gave us almost everything since the beginning of the Russian invasion. What about Israel? We understand that it is not easy for you, but we would very much like to write down in that column in front of your state in the tables about the assistance to our army - what we received. We would like to write something down there. We can also look at Poland. This state - like, by the way, the Baltic states - is under direct Russian military threat. It provides us with vital logistical assistance, it sheltered two and a half million Ukrainian migrants fleeing the war. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Denmark and many, many other countries shelter our people... Democratic countries - everyone did their best to shelter Ukrainian families - we are grateful to them. Most are women with children. They were fleeing the war, seeking refuge. Ireland, with which our culture has no such deep ties as with the culture of Israel, the people of Israel, the history of Israel, has even abolished the visa regime for Ukrainians so that they can simply come and save their lives and their children. Japan, Canada - they made it easier for us to enter. And the Israeli government has suspended the visa-free regime. This is happening right now. I do not want to judge that, I have no right. I have absolutely no right. This is the choice of each and every state. I just want you to think about it yourself. As for sanctions. When countries around the world impose sanctions on Russia, it's not about money, it's not about business. It's about values. It's about general security. It is about the fact that anyone who wants to destroy another nation must be held accountable. Japan - supported, Australia, the United States - many countries and many European states are working together - with us against Russian aggression. And, unfortunately, we have not yet seen Israel join the sanctions regime. However, I would like to thank you for the medications you sent to our country. Unfortunately, I have nothing to say about most of the items of the necessary assistance from Israel to Ukraine. Of course, we have such a situation with several states. It's true. But I can't tell them what I'm telling you. Why? Please remember our ties! How close we are. And how we should understand each other. And how we feel that your society understands these needs. I do not know why there is such a situation and misunderstanding with some government officials. That is why I have decided to tell you this today - I am not indifferent to the future relations between our states and nations. That's why I'm telling you this openly - face to face. I am sure that the war will end. We will win this war. And we have a common future. The great future of great nations, because we have such a great history, a great past. We will have to look each other in the eyes for many, many years to come. Especially your generation, because students are the future and it's wonderful. That's why I composed my address this way. So that you can draw conclusions and so that we can hear each other. With great respect for the history of Israel, for the people of Israel, for all of you. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, June 22, is the Day of Mourning and Remembrance of the Victims of War. That war. A war that was to remain forever in the history of the XX century and was never to be repeated. But it is repeated. Today there is no shortage of words that Russia did the same on February 24 as the Nazis did on June 22. Much has been said about this. And I want to add only one thing. Then 1418 days passed from the morning of the invasion to the defeat of the aggressor. We must liberate our land and achieve victory, but faster. Much faster. This is our national goal, and we must work to achieve it on a daily basis. Not only the state, but also every citizen - at the level at which it is possible. From the very morning I continued the telephone marathon for a positive decision on the candidacy for Ukraine. 11 leaders today. Bulgaria. I thanked Prime Minister of Bulgaria Petkov for supporting Ukraine and the development of the whole of Europe with our participation. Sweden. Prospects for bilateral cooperation and cooperation at the level of European structures were discussed with Prime Minister Andersson. Austria. I am grateful to Chancellor Nehammer for the political and humanitarian support, for understanding the needs of Ukraine. We can do a lot to develop relations between our states. Moldova. I spoke with President Sandu. We supported each other on the eve of an important meeting of the European Council. And we will help each other to complete this path to the European Union faster. Today I spoke again with President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda. I expressed full support to him over the situation around the Kaliningrad region of Russia. Tomorrow I will continue this marathon - we must provide maximum support to our state. We expect a key European decision tomorrow night. The occupiers struck at Mykolaiv, seven missiles. Fortunately, no one was killed. Five people were injured. There were strikes at the Kharkiv region as well. There are casualties. There were strikes at the borders of the Chernihiv and Sumy regions. In Donbas there are massive air and artillery strikes. The goal of the occupiers in this direction remains the same - they want to destroy the whole Donbas step by step. Entire. Lysychansk, Slovyansk, Kramatorsk - they aim to turn any city into Mariupol. Completely ruined. That is why we repeatedly emphasize the acceleration of weapons supplies to Ukraine. Parity is needed on the battlefield as soon as possible to stop this devilish armada and move it beyond the borders of Ukraine. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 195 combatants were awarded state awards, 17 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! We are preparing for the historic decision of the European Council, there are only a few hours left. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen! We are ready to amaze the world! I said these words in Toronto, at the Conference on Reforms in Ukraine, 3 years ago. Who could have imagined that 3 years later, the subtext and meaning of these words would undergo a ""large-scale reform”. 3 years ago, describing my vision of change in Ukraine, I gave the example of a team that you all know very well. This is the Toronto Raptors. 2019 NBA Champions. To win when no one expects that. To do the impossible by uniting. That's how I described our state goal and the common task of all Ukrainians. Who could have imagined that 3 years later it would sound completely different. Who could have imagined how big the difference would be between these times, between then and now, between the summer of 2019 and the summer of 2022. Those were different times. We strived for slightly different victories. We were building a slightly different state. A country of transparent institutions, equal and fair rules, successful and free people. Today, the walls of our buildings are ""transparent"" in the literal sense of the word - destroyed by Russian missiles and bombs. The rules of the game apply to everyone, but in a different sense. These are the rules of survival. They are equal, but not fair. Tough, cruel and simple. Shoot on the front, help in the rear. You hear an air alarm go down to the shelter. You hear the sound of enemy military equipment, stand up for the defense of your country. In 2019, I talked about peace in the east of Ukraine - a lot was said with Chrystia (Freeland - ed.) and Justin Trudeau - the liberation of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. We did everything possible for this, on all existing platforms, with the help of all existing diplomatic tools. Ukraine sincerely wanted and strived for this. But the other side wanted and strived for something else. We saw this ""something else"" in the morning of February 24. As a result, in 2022, Mariupol, Kramatorsk, Severodonetsk, Berdyansk, Melitopol and dozens of other cities and villages of Ukraine joined the words peace, liberation, Donetsk and Luhansk. We conducted the Crimea Platform. Today we are fighting back the aggression of the Russian Federation so that in the future there is no need to hold the Kherson Platform, the Mariupol Platform, the Kharkiv Platform and dozens of other platforms for the deoccupation of Ukraine's sovereign territories. Three years ago, my goal was a major infrastructure reform. Ukraine started the Large Construction. And it was impressive. Three years later, Russia launched a special military operation. We restored and created new roads, bridges, kindergartens, schools, hospitals, stadiums. Russia has been creating missiles and bombs all this time to destroy it all. Three years ago, in Toronto, I also talked about the restoration of Donbas. To do this, we gathered hundreds of investors and companies from around the world in Donbas and held a forum in Mariupol. Three years later, this city does not actually exist. It is erased from the face of the earth. In 2019, we talked about reconstruction in the east of Ukraine. According to preliminary estimates, this required about $ 10 billion. At the time, that figure seemed shocking. Three years later, it has grown exponentially, and now we need hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild. Now, in addition to the east, we are talking about the south, north, center and west of our country. Ukraine and Canada are separated by the ocean and 7 thousand kilometers, but there is a full mutual understanding between us. Ukraine and Russia are separated by a common border, but there is a huge abyss between us. In words, actions and most importantly - values. In 2019, I spoke about my dream country. About a state where the highest value is a person. In 2022, we are fighting against the aggressor whose highest value is weapons. My goal was large-scale digitization of Ukraine. And we became a State in a smartphone. The goal of Russia is large-scale occupation of Ukraine. And we became a country in army boots. A country in tanks, aircraft, ships. A country in trenches and shelters. Our way of life changed, but not our worldview. The path by which we are going to the goal changed, but the goal remained the same. Lecturers of our universities sometimes lecture their students from trenches, online, via Skype. Our teachers record video lessons and tasks for pupils in the subway, during the air alarm siren. Our servicemen can get married via Zoom without leaving the frontline positions. 3 years ago our goal was real decentralization. 3 years later the goal of Russia became “denazification” that no one understands. 3 years ago we spoke about capable local self-government. 3 years later we are talking about powerful territorial defense. Those were different times, but our goals remained the same. The only amendment is that to implement all this we are today fighting against the second army of the world. We are fighting for our future, our freedom, our land. Just as 80 years ago, during World War II. Today is a special day in Ukraine. The day when we recall the feat of our ancestors, express gratitude to them for our life and the opportunity to build a new Ukraine. The day of mourning and honoring the memory of the war victims, which we mark on June 22. Exactly on this day in 1941 the Nazis started bombing Kyiv. At 4 am. Those were different times, a different occupation, a different war, but our morale, striving for freedom, struggle and our goal haven’t changed. And on February 24, 2022, when Russian missiles hit Kyiv and the whole of Ukraine also at 4 am, we stood up for our country. Today, we are fighting for the future of our children and grandchildren, for their life and opportunity to build a new Ukraine. We have already amazed the world. We have united to do the impossible. We will definitely win, although no one expected that. For the sake of our peaceful, free and democratic future. And these will be different times. What exactly and how we will cover the path to them - I think we will discuss that today here. Thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you for the meeting. Thank you for your support, Canada.

And I am sure that none of us – none of you – have any doubt that Ukraine should get a positive decision. We deserve it! And we deserve it not only for our bravery and our fight for freedom. Russia's attack on Ukraine has restored to our memory the worst pages of history. Russian bombs are destroying cities. Russian soldiers are killing thousands of civilians. Russia is even carrying out mass deportations of Ukrainians. What is this?  This is Russia's attack against the whole free Europe – against our common values. Against human rights, the rule of law and conventions that protect everyone in Europe and the world. We will not allow to destroy our values!  I believe that together we can end the war with our victory as quickly as possible and we will rebuild everything Russia has destroyed. United Europe is definitely stronger than any tyranny! Even during such a brutal war, Ukrainian democratic institutions have been preserved. Even now we are extending the reach of the European values – yesterday the Ukrainian Parliament ratified the Istanbul Convention.  And no matter how much pressure Russia puts on us, we remain confident that Europe's future is bright and free, because we all stand together to protect it! I am grateful to all those who support us. Thank you for this sincerity, Amsterdam! Looking forward to a positive European decision for Ukraine! Embrace Ukraine, strengthen Europe!  Слава Україні!

0,"Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Today was a day of extremely active foreign policy activity - almost a marathon of phone conversations. We are increasing the number of those who stand for Ukraine’s candidacy and adding confidence that the decision on Friday will be positive. Slovakia. In a conversation with Prime Minister Heger, we coordinated our positions on the eve of the session of the European Council. Lithuania. I thanked President Nausėda for the decision of the Three Seas Initiative Summit to grant Ukraine the status of a partner-participant. We also coordinated our steps. Hungary. There was a very fruitful conversation with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. I invited him to visit Ukraine and thanked him for the important support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. We agreed to develop cooperation in the energy sector. Portugal. We agreed with Prime Minister António Costa to involve his country's experience in our rapprochement with the European Union. Spain. In a conversation with Prime Minister Sánchez I noted that our cooperation would strengthen both Ukraine and the entire European Union. The possible outcome of the NATO Summit in Madrid, which will take place in late June, was discussed. Ireland. I noted Ireland's active support for our European integration and invited Irish Prime Minister Martin to visit Ukraine. Croatia. I am confident that we can expand our cooperation both bilaterally and at the level of European structures. I thanked Prime Minister Plenković for his support of Ukraine. I was happy to see in Kyiv a great friend of our state - Prime Minister of Luxembourg Bettel. And I would like to draw your attention once again to the assistance from Luxembourg. 15% of the defense budget of this state – this was a contribution to the defense of Ukraine. Both the greatness and the nobility of the state are immediately felt. My schedule for tomorrow is as busy as today. I will do my best to ensure that the historic decision of the European Union is adopted. This is important for us. By the way, today, without delay, I signed the law on ratification of the Istanbul Convention adopted yesterday. Protecting all people from violence and discrimination is our principle. In all negotiations, I always emphasize that the seventh package of the European Union sanctions is needed as soon as possible. Russia must feel a constant increase in pressure for the war and for its aggressive anti-European policy. Another Russian threat to Lithuania, another wave of energy pressure, another batch of lies from Russian officials about the food crisis are all arguments to agree on the seventh package of sanctions. The situation on the frontline is without significant changes. With the help of tactical moves, the Ukrainian army is strengthening its defense in the Luhansk region, which is really the toughest area right now. The occupiers are also putting serious pressure on the Donetsk direction. In the Kharkiv region there is brutal and cynical Russian artillery shelling. It will not give anything to the occupiers, but the Russian army is deaf to any rationality. It simply destroys, simply kills - in this way it shows its command that it is not standing still. In the south we defend our Mykolaiv region, our Zaporizhzhia, and gradually liberate the Kherson region. And just as actively as we fight for a positive decision of the European Union on the candidacy for Ukraine, we fight every day for the supply of modern weapons for our country. We do not decrease our activity for a single day. The lives of thousands of people depend directly on the speed of our partners - on the speed of implementation of their decisions to help Ukraine. Today I signed two major decrees on awarding our defenders. At the request of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 210 combatants were awarded, 3 of them posthumously. At the request of the Minister of Internal Affairs, 255 warriors of the National Guard of Ukraine were awarded, 41 of them posthumously, 41 border guards, 12 of them posthumously, and 45 policemen. And I want you to realize that when I talk about signing such decrees, it's not just a routine and not something mechanical. It is only thanks to the mass courage and wisdom of our people on the battlefield that Ukraine lives and can really count on victory. Eternal glory to all who fight for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

Our brave soldiers, our brave defenders are fighting back against the Russian army. 117 days ago, everything changed for Ukraine. We are defending against a nuclear state that has unlimited access to money and has disregarded any limits on violence. I’ll be honest with you – the end of this war and its circumstances depend on the world's attention. And that's why I need allies. We need people like you.  You are the most creative people in the world – always on the cutting edge. Whether it’s the Refugee Flag or the Fearless Girl, the Ice Bucket Challenge or the Rivers of Light – every time you find words and images to reach the depths of the human soul, you make people talk about issues everyone would otherwise overlook. I am sure that you will do a lot more to promote Ukrainian bravery. Your campaigns and your work will make our fight for freedom legendary. Because we are fighting not only for our own freedom but for the freedom of the entire democratic world; for all of those who cannot even imagine the extent of tyranny and censorship that exist in Russia. Now you can bring peace to Europe simply by applying your professional qualities. I believe that the power of human creativity is greater than the power of a nuclear state that is stuck in the past.  Speak of Ukraine! Don't let the world switch to something else! The world must remember that Ukraine is fighting for freedom. This fight must end in our victory as soon as possible. Your every success will mean saving thousands of lives. Thank you!  Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians! Step by step, we are going through a crucial week and we are doing everything every day so that no one has any doubts that Ukraine deserves the candidacy. We prove every day that we are already part of a united European, I would even say, value space. Now the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada have already left, and I am here. And you know, I'd like to thank them today. We often criticize them, but today they did a very good job. I am grateful to all our people’s deputies who supported our European integration. I would like to note the vote in favor of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. This Convention is often called the Istanbul Convention - according to the place of signature. It has been ""undermined"" in Ukraine for decades. But its main content is simple - it is the obligation to protect against violence and various forms of discrimination. I would also like to thank the deputies who supported the Law on Waste Management. This is an important environmental document. We have been struggling for it for three years. The law has been rejected several times due to oligarchic influence, and now it has been passed. Finally. Thank you. The Anticorruption strategy was approved today. This is also very important. I hope that the Rada will continue to work with the same significant results. I delivered four addresses today. The first was to the participants of the Three Seas Initiative Summit. It is a powerful regional association in Europe. 12 states between the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea. Before addressing, I spoke with President Duda. We coordinated our positions with Andrzej. And at the summit it was decided that Ukraine acquires a status that will allow it to become a full member of the Three Seas Initiative. For us, these are significant economic opportunities, modernization of transport, communications and networks. This is another line of close cooperation between Ukraine and the EU states. By the way, we have good news from our border with Poland. In the framework of the Open Border project, the capacity of the Krakovets’-Korczowa checkpoint has been increased by 50 percent. This will significantly increase the export-import flow across the border. Modernization awaits other checkpoints on the borders with the European Union. And it is tangible, and not only for us. Allows doing global things. Fighting the food crisis provoked by Russia's blockade of ports. I spoke about it in an address to the leaders of the African Union. I stressed that this crisis is artificial - it would not exist if it was not for the Russian war against us. I also stressed that we can ensure the supply of agricultural products in the amount that will definitely guarantee the security of Africa, the security of Asia. In general, we are expanding the capabilities of our state. Like all powerful European countries, we need our own policies towards Africa, Latin America, South-East Asia and other parts of the world that were previously left out of proper attention of Ukraine's foreign policy. We are working on the agency of Ukraine. I also addressed the participants of the Global Policy Forum in Italy. Very influential meeting. I talked about how to bring all Ukrainian migrants home. Today I met with Ben Stiller, a well-known actor and UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador who is engaged in providing assistance to displaced persons and refugees. I am grateful to Ben for his constant attention to the needs of Ukrainians. I met with President of the General Confederation of Italian Industry Carlo Bonomi. We talked about the ties between Ukrainian and Italian business. I am grateful for the opening of the Confederation's office in Kyiv. And the shortest, but very important address was made to the participants of the International Festival of Creativity in Cannes - the largest such event in the world. The Cannes Lions is a special audience. These are people who know how to control attention and who are very much needed in Ukraine right now. The longer the war lasts, the harder it is to compete for the attention of hundreds of millions of people in different countries. But I will do everything possible so that attention to Ukraine does not fade. I called on the most creative people in the world to be our allies in this. And I know that the response in Cannes was very positive. The next days of the week will also be busy. We are moving towards the main decision of the European Council, which will be adopted on Friday. As I predicted, Russia is very nervous about our activity. Again shelling of Kharkiv, Odesa, again attempts of brutal offensive actions in Donbas. This is an evil that can only be appeased on the battlefield. We are defending Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. This whole region is the most difficult, there are the hardest battles. But our strong boys and girls are there. The occupiers receive responses to their actions against us. I am grateful to the army and intelligence that provide it. In the evening I signed another decree on awarding our defenders. 220 combatants were awarded state awards. 27 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who defend our state! Glory to you! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Thank you very much! Now I would like to address all the participants of the forum. Dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you today. Everything needs to be done today. And so it happened that today is World Refugee Day. Unfortunately, this day has recently become especially painful for all of us, for millions of Ukrainians. To be precise, for more than 12 million of our citizens. Imagine! Those who at the beginning of this year had a home, complete security, plans for the future. And all this was destroyed by the Russian invasion. More than 12 million Ukrainians have become migrants. They left their cities, communities and sought refuge in a safe area. Where at least Russian artillery does not reach. But what is our goal now? What do I want to say today? We must do everything we can to ensure that Ukrainian migrants return home. No matter how many of them there are and wherever they seek protection, we must provide them with a real opportunity and internal interest to return to Ukraine. We can set a historical precedent. Earlier, when the aggressor started a war against another state, he hoped that the war would break the victim. And now we have proved that Ukraine cannot be broken. But this is not enough. That is why this is a key element - the ability of people to return home. Due to the Russian war against Ukraine, Europe is experiencing the biggest migrant crisis in decades. When else was it that 12 million people lost their home and security in just a few months? Only World War II comes to mind. Russia has deliberately created such conditions. Mariupol – almost half a million inhabitants. Different cities. Severodonetsk – 100 thousand inhabitants. Volnovakha – 22 thousand inhabitants. So it was. But Russia destroyed everything there. Artillery, aircraft, missiles - they did not spare tools. I can name hundreds of other cities that have already been destroyed. And I can name dozens of other cities that are still threatened by Russian strikes. Now the Russian army is trying to gather forces to attack Kharkiv again. We de-occupied this region. And they want to do it again, and we see it. And there are one and a half million inhabitants. Mykolaiv is constantly being bombed, with almost half a million inhabitants. They want to capture and completely destroy Slovyansk - there were 100 thousand inhabitants before the war. Of course, we will do everything possible to stop the occupiers, to protect the people. But to do it faster, we need support, modern weapons. Such weapons, which have potential greater than that of the Russian army. That is why I spend so much emotion, so much time and so much effort to convince all our partners to give us powerful weapons. It's a matter of lives. The second point is the economy. And as long as the war continues, as long as Russian missiles hit our cities, normal economic life is simply impossible. Up to half of our entire economy, up to half of our economic system is not working now. Imagine what it would be like if half of Italy's economy was completely blocked. Its industrial part and all your ports. No state can survive such a situation without financial assistance. And when we say that Ukraine needs about $ 5 billion a month to cover the budget deficit, it's not just a number, it's not about money. It's about how many millions of Ukrainians will still have something to live for. Live in Ukraine. The third point is reconstruction. We must do absolutely everything so that after our victory - I have no doubt about it - we would be able not just to restore normal living conditions in the areas where the Russian occupiers tried to leave only scorched debris, but to build a life so modern, so safe that it would affect the aggressor as well. That is, not only sanctions, not only the physical losses of the Russian army on the battlefield, but also the very fact of restoring life in Ukraine. Life itself is a priority. The very fact that we can rise from the ashes. And the aggressor state will remain with losses and degradation only. Our goal is for this migrant crisis in Europe caused unconditionally and solely by the Russian war to be truly the last such crisis. So that any other aggressor does not even think that with the help of war it will be possible to destroy the life of any European country. Weapons for Ukraine, financial support, the future reconstruction of our state - these are three elements that must work to the fullest. But that's not all we have to do. The Russian war against us has provoked a global food crisis. If it is not stopped immediately, our 12 million forcibly displaced persons will simply be a drop in the ocean of possible new migration flows. Before this speech, I have just addressed the representatives of the African Union - and I have placed an emphasis on this. On food security. Ukraine can supply food to the world market in the amount to meet the critical needs of dozens of countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Without our exports, there is a deficit, which can lead to chaos. Political chaos, economic chaos, migration chaos. And only this year we can do everything so that on the next World Refugee Day we will not have to discuss how to cope with tens of millions of migrants in Europe and in the regions bordering Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is a special moment now. A moment when the fate of millions of people depends on the decisions of European and world politicians. The moment when it is being decided whether peace will come to Ukraine soon. Therefore, it is being decided whether we will soon be able to say that we are already solving the problems I talked about today. And I urge you - be active! I am grateful to Italy for its principled position. But we need to do even more for Ukraine to win. I repeat - weapons for Ukraine, financial support and reconstruction of our state. Three elements that can change everything. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Distinguished heads of state and government, Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for this opportunity to address you. Address you in a state of emergency, when we have a war. In an emergency for the whole world, when Africa is actually taken hostage. Hostage of those who started the war against our state. Yes, this is war. Russia's war against Ukraine. Not a crisis, not a conflict, as it is still defined sometimes. No, this is a war! A brutal war, a war of invasion. Russian troops have come to our land and want to conquer our people. This war may seem very distant to you and your countries. But catastrophically rising food prices have already brought it home to millions of African families. As well as to many families in Asia, Europe, Latin America. The unjust and provoked by the Russian war level of food prices is painfully felt on all continents. Unfortunately, this can become a particular problem for your countries. We need to take into account various factors - population growth on the African continent, the ongoing economic recovery after the pandemic, the lack of domestic financial resources in many countries to buy food at much higher prices. Given the physical shortage in the global market, some countries on the African continent find it particularly difficult to maintain the necessary food supplies. But why and when did this problem arise? I emphasize that such a problem did not exist on February 23 this year. It is true that unusual inflationary processes have already taken place in different parts of the world. Various countries have already sent huge sums of money to support the economy in the crisis through COVID-19. However, there was nothing like a food shortage. The crisis began on February 24, when the Russian fleet blocked Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The sea route is the main one for the agrarian sector of our state. And Ukrainian agricultural exports are one of the foundations of the stability of the global food market. Ukraine is one of the main suppliers of wheat, sunflower oil and corn. According to expert estimates, the lives of about four hundred million people in different countries of the world depend on the export of our food. And if it was not for the Russian war against Ukraine, there simply would be no shortage in the food market. If it was not for the Russian war, our farmers and agricultural companies could have ensured record harvests this year. If it was not for the Russian war, people in Africa, people in Asia and anywhere else in the world would not suffer from the catastrophic rise in food prices. There simply would not be such a catastrophic rise in prices. Ladies and Gentlemen! This situation shows how connected everything is in the world. One war in Europe, namely Russia's attempt to seize our land, to turn Ukraine into a Russian colony, has led to a deterioration in access to food and a growing threat of famine everywhere. Of course, we are defending ourselves, of course, we will defend our independence until we win this war. And, of course, we are already trying to build new supply logistics. Right now we have more than 25 million tons of grain in the elevators awaited by traditional consumers of Ukrainian products. We are establishing exports by rail and through the ports of neighboring countries, so that last year's harvest and this year's harvest could reach consumers. But much smaller volume can be supplied via new routes, and it takes much more time. This results in a much more expensive supply. We are holding complex multilevel negotiations to unblock our Ukrainian ports. But you see that there is no progress yet. Because no real tool has yet been found to ensure that Russia does not attack them again. That is why the food crisis in the world will continue as long as this colonizing war continues, Russia's war against our state, and as long as our ports are blocked. Ukraine was also one of the main European producers of fertilizers. And now production is virtually stopped - again because of the war. Some manufacturers do not have the raw materials and even the ability to work - due to the threat of Russian missile strikes and other consequences of hostilities. Some companies are already in combat zones and were simply destroyed by Russian troops. Have you heard about this from your Russian partners with whom you maintain contact? Did they tell you that? I'm sure they're telling you completely different things. But, in fact, they need this crisis. They are deliberately exacerbating it. Because they are trying to use you and the suffering of the people to put pressure on the democracies that have imposed sanctions on Russia. I emphasize that the sanctions policy is aimed only to stop Russia from trying to turn Ukraine into its slave. Ladies and Gentlemen! We all see that the existing architecture of global security and international organizations are not yet able to influence the aggressor state to end this war and restore international security. Did the UN Security Council work? No. Moreover, your voice in the UN Security Council - the voice of Africa - has not been fully heard. But in today's globalized world, a world without Africa and Africa without ties with the world are impossible. And it is right that the African Union conducts a principled activity, defending the interests of all the inhabitants of your continent. However, your voice should be strong enough in all international structures. And if they need to be reformed for that, including the UN Security Council, then we need to do so. That is why, for example, on April 5, in my address to the UN Security Council, I proposed to convene in Kyiv - of course, after this war and our victory - a global conference on UN reform and transformation. I also launched a new policy of Ukraine towards Africa. It was during my term that the first Strategy for the Development of Ukraine's Relations with African States was approved. Dialogue with all countries of the continent will be intensified. The Special Representative of Ukraine for African Affairs will also start working in the near future. I want us to fully understand one another and interact without intermediaries - for our common interests. And the fact that there are such interests is quite obvious after February 24. Because the stability of your countries depends on the stability in Ukraine and in our region. Pursuant to my instruction, the first regional tour of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine to the states of Sub-Saharan Africa is being prepared. Of course, we also need to develop inter-parliamentary dialogue. To this end, I am initiating visits to African countries by representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. I invite you to visit our country now to renew our bilateral ties. And I propose to start preparing, with our common willingness, a large political and economic conference ""Ukraine - Africa"". In many countries of the African Union, Ukraine is well known economically and in the educational sphere. In fact, our relationship is very old. Our specialists have been building enterprises in your countries in Soviet times. Your students have studied at our universities and are studying now. We have always contributed to the maintenance of peace on the African continent. Until February 24, more than 300 Ukrainian blue helmets performed tasks within six UN missions. And our national contingent, including the 18th Separate Helicopter Detachment, was an important part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And it is on this basis of the relationship that has existed for many, many years that we must build a new political history. We can do it. We must free our people from the threats artificially created for us by any states that simply want to conquer us, use our resources and our land. And our number one task now is to finally get rid of the threat of famine. In the XXI century, such a threat simply cannot exist - thanks to Ukraine, thanks to our agricultural sector. We cover any deficits, we produce everything so that there is enough food for each of your countries, all consumers with whom we work. If it wasn't for the Russian war, you would be in a completely different position now - completely safe. That is why, in order to avoid famine, the efforts of states like Russia to return to the aggressive policy of colonialism must end. The time of empires is over! People have the right to just live, just live and have everything for life. Thank you very much for this opportunity to address you! Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Thank you for all the kind words in support of Ukraine! For what has just been said, for what you and our friends have done for the strength of our state! Dear colleagues, friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful to you and I have the honor to address all present today. I will begin my address immediately with the key thing, given our precious time. I'll start with what we offer. First, Ukraine must be a participant in the Three Seas Initiative. It is wrong that our state remained outside the Initiative. We need to find a format in which we can implement the accession. Just one look at the geographical map of our region is enough to understand that it is only with Ukraine that all our countries can realize their full potential. Economic, infrastructural, potential of social ties between our countries, between our people and the historical basis of life in our region. Based on this, my second suggestion is to strengthen the interpretation of cooperation in the framework of the Three Seas Initiative. Every sphere we can work on together in this Initiative is really about security. And first of all it is logistics. Please look at the Ukrainian situation now: it is the states of the Three Seas that are our connection to the free world. The supply of weapons to Ukraine, the supply of fuel, the preservation of vital transport flows, green corridors for the export of Ukrainian food, the migration of people - all this works through the territory of the member states of this Initiative. In the same way, the Three Seas Initiative is destined to become an effective rear for any country in our region, if it is also - God forbid, of course - threatened by Russia. When the enemy comes, everything matters: roads, railways, ports, the energy system, speed at the borders, even the habit of working together. That is why it is our duty to deepen all connections in this space. It is these connections that are our security, after all. The third proposal is energy. Ukraine has one of the most powerful gas storage facilities in the region and an extensive gas supply network. Therefore, by cooperating with our neighbors, using the capacities of the Poland-Slovakia, Poland-Ukraine interconnectors, as well as the LNG terminals available in the region, we can meet the needs of all the countries of the Three Seas Initiative. Already after the start of a full-scale Russian invasion, we joined the European Union's energy system. And now our electricity exports can be a contribution to the energy balance of your countries, which will help you become completely independent of Russian energy pressure. The fourth suggestion is that we must do everything we can to make the Trans-European Corridor Via Carpathia work one hundred percent, connecting northern and southern Europe. Ukraine can play the role of one of the logistics centers. And we are ready to join Via Carpathia right now. We are ready to integrate into the European railway network, in particular through the Warsaw-Kyiv railway line and access to the Rail Baltica railway corridor. We must continue to work on expanding checkpoints on the borders of our state. Fifth proposal - Ukraine can support many infrastructure projects in the field of digitization and strengthen our regional digital ties. Keep in mind that the Ukrainian experience in combating cyber threats is truly unique and can be very useful for each of your countries. And the sixth proposal - participation in the project of reconstruction of Ukraine. This will be the largest economic project of our generation. Politicians often say that economic prosperity is the foundation of national security. And it really is. But not as often as they say, politicians manage to implement this principle. That is to make the economy so powerful that the state itself becomes powerful enough. Now we have such a historic chance. But only if we work together will we be able to use it. The Three Seas Initiative needs the potential of Ukraine. We are ready. We are willing. For the first time, Ukraine has been invited to participate in the Three Seas Initiative Summit today. I am grateful. However, you know - while this war is going on, I can't leave the state. So I can't be with you right now. But I am sure that you can now involve us in specific infrastructure projects, and will find a status that will allow us to participate in the activities of your Initiative. I believe it is possible!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! There were many congratulations in our country today. June 19 is Medical Workers’ Day, Father's Day and Farmer's Day. Of course, today I would like to thank all our doctors, all Ukrainian nurses, who have been literally on the frontline since February 24. Thank you for the tens of thousands of second birthdays you gave to our military, our civilians, our Ukrainian children. Thank you for saving lives on the front, in hospitals across our country. Ukrainian doctors are countless examples of extraordinary heroism. Heroism of those who carried out surgeries under shelling. Who worked in the blockade in Mariupol. Who survived the occupation, captivity and even in such conditions, as much as possible, saved lives - the most precious thing. I would also like to thank our farmers today. Those who defended their communities even with bare hands when stopping the Russian military. Who, despite the war, ensured a sowing campaign. Those who were even nicknamed ""tractor troops"" when they were taking Russian trophy equipment from the battlefield. And now that Russia has blocked our exports through the Black Sea ports, the whole world has seen who Ukrainian farmers really are and what the work of our agricultural sector is worth. Of course, I would like to thank all the fathers in Ukraine. All those who raised their children as good, decent, brave people. People who defend the state and do everything to help their neighbors live through the war. The Ukrainian courage that inspires the world so much, the Ukrainian freedom that strengthens the whole of Europe are possible only because Ukrainian parents have raised such children. Children with an understanding of values, able to be true heroes. Tomorrow a truly historic week begins. A week when we will hear the answer from the European Union on the candidate status for Ukraine. We already have a positive decision from the European Commission, and at the end of the new week there will be a response from the European Council. I think it is obvious to everyone that since 1991 there have been few such fateful decisions for Ukraine as we expect now. And I am convinced that only a positive decision meets the interests of the whole of Europe. I will deliver new addresses this week, including to Europeans. I will take every opportunity to defend the European perspective for Ukraine, for each of us, and to gather new supporters for us. Obviously, we should expect greater hostile activity from Russia. Purposefully - demonstratively. This week exactly. And not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries. We are preparing. We are ready. We warn partners. The occupiers are accumulating forces in the Kharkiv direction, in the Zaporizhzhia region. They struck at our fuel infrastructure again - they want to worsen the fuel situation. Of course, we will respond to this, too. Fierce fighting continues in Donbas. The Russian army uses the greatest number of artillery there, the greatest number of offensive forces. But Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka and other hot spots are holding on. Our people are like that. They are holding on. Our army is holding on. And I am grateful to everyone whose strength today means our victory tomorrow. Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Fights hard! Glory to Ukraine!

I am coming back from the south - visited today our frontline positions in the Mykolaiv region, visited Mykolaiv itself, and the Odesa region as well. I talked to our defenders - military, police, National Guard, territorial defense. Their mood is confident, and looking into their eyes it is obvious that they all do not doubt our victory. Thanked them for the service, for the protection of our state. Thanked the parents of such brave children. Really very strong. Presented awards to the best. Presented the Order of the Golden Star to the Hero of Ukraine Colonel Vadym Sukharevsky, commander of the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade. We will not give away the south to anyone, we will return everything that's ours and the sea will be Ukrainian and safe. Both in Mykolaiv, and in Odesa I held meetings with our military, with all officials who are responsible for defense and maintenance of these two regions. Listened to the reports on the destruction of the regions caused by Russian strikes. The losses are significant. Many houses were destroyed, civilian logistics were disrupted, there are many social issues. I have commissioned to make assistance to people who have lost loved ones more systemic. We will definitely restore everything that was destroyed. Russia does not have as many missiles as our people have the desire to live. Substantively discussed the economic situation, the work of the agricultural sector. Discussed the security of our ports and opportunities for the export of our agricultural products. Our position is clear and unchanged - as soon as we can ensure security through international mediation, Ukraine will do everything possible to counter the food crisis that broke out across the world – in Asia, Africa and most countries of the world – due to the Russian war. I visited city hospitals in Mykolaiv and Odesa. I thanked the doctors and nurses - they are our heroes. On the eve of the Medical Workers’ Day, I congratulated them on their professional holiday. I had a conversation with our defenders wounded in battles. Yesterday I signed a decree conferring the rank of Major General upon the Commander of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Tetyana Ostashchenko. Today I had the honor to personally congratulate Tetyana Mykolaivna on this rank. And I always say in my appeals on purpose – male and female defenders. I want all of us in Ukraine to always emphasize the contribution of both men and women to the defense of our state. My main impressions today are absolute pride in our people.

The only thing left is to wait for the decision of the European Council next week. And I believe that Ukraine has done everything possible for this step to be positive as well – the decision of the European Council, i.e. the leaders of the EU states. Ukraine deserves this positive. Ukrainian values are European values. Ukrainian institutions maintain resilience even in conditions of war. Ukrainian democratic habits have not lost their power even now. And our rapprochement with the European Union is not only positive for us. This is the greatest contribution to the future of Europe in many years. Let me remind you now only one thing: after February 24, our country acceded to the European energy system. Our networks - Ukraine and the European Union - work in sync despite a full-scale war. Hence, even this fact alone shows everything at once - the professionalism of our people, the strength of our institutions, our ability to fulfill promises and the magnitude of Ukraine's potential. And I want to emphasize that Ukraine's European integration is not something purely political, not something detached from the lives of ordinary people. On the contrary. The closer we are to other European countries, the more opportunities we will have to guarantee all Ukrainians a modern and prosperous life. Today I will also speak with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte. I use every opportunity for our interests, for Ukraine. During yesterday's visit to Kyiv by the leaders of France, Germany, Romania and Italy, it was clear what far-reaching prospects are being opened both for our country and for all Europeans if we continue to work together. And today this understanding has become even clearer. European strength, European independence and European development can be imagined truly powerful only with Ukraine. It is interesting, by the way, how the course of history chooses the time for important decisions: the government of Ukraine abolished the agreement on visa-free regime with the Russian Federation today. Now the visa regime will be effective starting from July 1. It is difficult to overestimate the symbolism of what happened today. But no one picked the moment on purpose. This is what the course of history is. Russia itself has done everything to destroy any ties with Ukraine. Well, we are doing everything to make our ties with Europe as strong as possible. Boris Johnson visited Kyiv today. This is already the second visit of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to our capital since February 24. The negotiations are positive. We discussed the situation on the frontline and ways to achieve our victory. I am grateful to Boris for his leadership in supporting Ukraine, including with weapons. I am also grateful that we equally perceive the need for unconditional protection of our state. We talked about security guarantees for Ukraine. When we define the parameters of these guarantees, they will determine the future of Ukrainians and all Europeans for generations to come. In general, the week was maximally useful for Ukraine – in many areas. And I would also like to thank US President Biden today for increasing American support for Ukraine every week. And this week we have significant results on the front exactly due to the support of the United States. I have just signed new decrees on awarding our heroes. 413 combatants were awarded state awards, 29 of them posthumously. And finally. Today I can already announce this: we managed to liberate “Tayra”, Ukrainian paramedic Yulia Payevska, from captivity. I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result. ""Tayra"" is already home. We will keep working to liberate everyone. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our independence and our freedom! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear Presidents, Prime Ministers, Parliamentarians! Dear attendees! Friends! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and leave my arguments for discussion at your important Forum. Now is a historic moment for Europe and European security, when everyone has to decide: what Europe is and what Europe will be like in the future. Will it be as free as it is now? Will it be as safe as most Europeans are used to? Will it be as socially and economically developed, inspiring societies outside Europe to change their way of life? Russia has challenged us all - every nation on the continent, every region of Europe. For Ukraine, this is the most dreadful military challenge, and we have been defending ourselves for 113 days already against Russia's ambition to destroy the Ukrainian people and our culture. Ukrainian cities destroyed by the Russian army; millions of migrants; hundreds of thousands of people deported by the Russian military; and tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed are all blatant manifestations of Russia's anti-European policy. By starting this war against Ukraine, Russia tried to create a springboard for an attack on other nations of Europe. That is why our defense in this war and our future victory are fundamentally important for the security of everyone in Europe. But in addition to this blatant manifestation of Russia's anti-European policy, there are many other manifestations of it. Smaller, but still very vile and destructive, openly aggressive. And I would like to draw your attention to the fact that today there is not a single country left in Europe that has not suffered from at least one of the many manifestations of Russia's anti-European policy. Ladies and Gentlemen! All of us in a democratic world have faced an unprecedented energy crisis. For many years, Russia has been creating the impression that it is allegedly a reliable supplier of energy resources. But in reality it managed to make different European countries dependent on it. And now, when Russia decided to wage a war to conquer European nations, it used this energy chain first. It specially provoked historically extremely high gas prices. It specially restricts gas supplies, blackmailing individual countries and Europe as a whole. It violates existing contracts – requires payment for gas in rubles and artificially limits the volume of supply. This pressure on the gas market, as well as the use of other instruments by Russia, has led to a significant acceleration of inflation. This simply would not be the case if Russia acted as a responsible supplier and did not want to create a crisis. An even worse scenario is being implemented in the food market. It provokes not only rising prices for basic foodstuffs, but also a new migrant crisis. Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports and strikes at our agro-industrial infrastructure cause deficits in important regional segments of the world food market. Ukrainian wheat, corn, sunflower oil and other commodities have been indispensable for global food stability. Russia knew where to hit to create this crisis. And it deliberately increases it prolonging the war against our state and refusing to make the Black Sea safe for navigation. Why is it doing this? So that a new migrant wave hits, in particular, your countries, as well as your neighbors in Europe. How many millions of refugees will there be in Europe if Russian policy causes famine in African and Asian countries? And if the shortage of products there and the price crisis provoke political chaos and the fall of governments? Will you then be able to pursue a consolidated policy? That's why Russia wants a food crisis. And I will mention another element of Russia's anti-European policy. Russia is perhaps the world's largest investor in propaganda - and not just for domestic audience. Russia spends billions of dollars a year to deceive foreign audience and to incite hostility. And the connection between propaganda and war is obvious: in the first months of this year, Russia's propaganda budget was tripled. I am sure that each and every one of you knows what propaganda tools have worked or are still working against your states. And this instrument of Russia has only one task: to make it worse. In particular, worse for you. Ladies and Gentlemen! That is why any serious discussion of the security architecture in Europe must be based on the need to free Europe from the chains of dependence that the Russian state has been creating for decades. Security is simply impossible without it, and it is the same for the north of Europe, for the south, for the west and for the east. That is why such sanctions are needed for anti-European policy of Russia, so that they will forever remember the price, including for the food crisis. The one who creates artificial famine must become a global outcast and suffer painful losses. This should be taken into account in the preparation of the seventh EU sanctions package. And we need to realize that sanctions packages have, in fact, become part of the continent's security architecture. They work for stability and peace - limiting Russia's ability to expand aggression. Europe's full energy independence is needed. Any ties with Russia that it uses to make money on Europe and pursue anti-European policy must be severed. There can be no trade with Russia - you should not give money to those who seek your destruction. And most importantly - we need to make the whole of Europe finally united. This is what Ukraine and your countries - the Western Balkans - are equally interested in. Full-fledged European integration of Ukraine, as well as full-fledged European integration of your states, is a historical strengthening of Europe and a complete dismantling of Russia's ability to beat us one by one. The EU-Western Balkans High Level Summit will take place shortly. I sincerely wish it will be successful for your states. And I am grateful to you for the support of Ukraine that you provide at various levels, so that this June will be successful for our country in relations with the EU. By answering us about our European perspective and by answering you about your European perspective, the nations of Europe and European politicians are answering questions about the future of Europe. These are the questions I voiced at the beginning of my address. What will Europe be like in the future? Will it be as free as it is now? Will it be as safe as most Europeans are used to? Will it be as socially and economically developed, inspiring societies outside Europe to change their way of life? We need a positive answer – to our and your European perspective. And I am grateful to you for working together on such an answer. I wish us all success! I wish us all victory! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Of course, all relevant procedures must be followed, and all EU member states must join. But at our meeting today a big step was made - a step forward. It was important for me to hear from the leaders another fundamental thing - they agree that the end of the war and peace for Ukraine must be exactly as Ukraine sees them. As our people see them. I am grateful to Italy for its principled political support, macro-financial and defense assistance. Historically we now have the best relations - and I am sure we can do a lot more for our nations. I am grateful to Romania for the defense assistance and assistance in the transit of our goods, including grain. We agreed to increase export capacity through the territory of Romania. France will provide additional Caesar artillery systems. This is very important for our defense. Also today, President Macron openly said that the European support for Ukraine should really demonstrate that we defend the same values, defend Europe together. Germany has confirmed the provision of air defense systems for our country and further support. By the way, when four leaders arrived in Kyiv today, it coincided with the beginning of the air raid siren. Russia has created a background for everyone to hear these sirens to create a tense atmosphere. But no one was scared, and it only inspired us to be as specific as possible and to negotiate for our interests - for all Ukrainians and for all in Europe. Today I personally thanked Chancellor Scholz for inviting me to the G7 meeting. In general, my impression of the meeting is positive. All leaders understand why negotiations to end the war are not under way. Exclusively because of Russia's position, which is only trying to intimidate everyone in Europe and continue the destruction of our state. They do not want to look for a way to peace. This is an aggressor who must decide for himself that the war must end. We will continue to fight until we guarantee our state full security and territorial integrity. We talked today about the preparation of a new sanctions package against Russia. We talked about overcoming the food crisis provoked by Russia. The resumption of exports of Ukrainian agricultural products is vital for dozens of countries. And there is only one reason why the food crisis has become possible at all: Russia is to blame, and no one else. All leaders already recognize this. We talked about the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war - we have very specific views of partners on this. I believe that it is not a coincidence that the situation with gas in Europe has worsened today - the price has jumped again. Russia has done this on purpose, restricting supplies to harm Europe, to strike at Europeans. Gazprom is simply pulling on the gas chain in which they have been trying to shackle Europe for a long time. And this is another argument in favor of the fact that Europe must now switch to life without Russian gas. There should be no such dependence. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow there will also be a lot of news for Ukraine, and I believe that they will be positive. I really believe that. I would like to emphasize once again that all this is possible first of all thanks to our heroes, thanks to each and everyone who protects us from Russian troops. Today, the Ukrainian army is fighting in the conditions of a significant quantitative advantage of the enemy - in technology, in artillery systems. Fighting in such conditions is a daily feat. We do everything to give our heroes modern and powerful weapons. And I am proud of all those who have been repelling the occupier and all the attacks for 113 days of the full-scale war already. It is thanks to the bravery of Ukrainian men and women that Europe can create this new history of freedom and finally remove the ""gray"" zone between the EU and Russia in Eastern Europe. Ukraine has come closest to the European Union since independence. Eternal glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine! Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by these occupiers!

0,"Good health to you! The long and very busy day is over. Foreign policy has been a priority since the morning. In two vital areas at once - defense and Europe. I have just finished my conversation with Boris Johnson. Key topics were defense support and coordination of steps on the eve of important meetings in June. Today there is a lot of news about the third meeting in the ""Rammstein"" format. This is a format for the work of defense ministers of partner countries that determine the support packages for our country. And the news is really good. We expect an increase in this support.  By the way, we have another signal that defense support for Ukraine will be continued. As part of Rammstein, Britain and Denmark announced a special donors' conference in Copenhagen in August. 14 states are preliminary involved. I had an important conversation with US President Biden today. The United States has announced a new strengthening of our defense, a new $ 1 billion support package including coastal defense, artillery, modern rocket systems. We will be looking forward to it. I am grateful for this support, it is especially important for our defense in Donbas. I am also grateful for the leadership in mobilizing the help of all partners. There is also a new package of humanitarian support for Ukraine - a quarter of a billion US dollars. We also discussed with President Biden the tactical situation on the battlefield and ways to accelerate our victory. Sanctions, politics, economic cooperation - we are preparing for new steps. I was invited to speak at the NATO Summit in Madrid, as well as at the G7 meeting. In the afternoon there was a special summit with the leaders of the Western Balkans - the Prime Ministers of Montenegro and Albania came to Kyiv, and the Prime Minister of North Macedonia was present in a video format. Ukraine has received a significant decision by these countries to support the status of a candidate for EU membership for us - three countries have adopted such a joint statement. In fact, today we are as close to this status as we couldn’t have dreamed of even a few years ago. Ukraine has done everything possible to obtain a candidacy. And today, in my address to the Parliament of the Czech Republic, I emphasized that the response to our candidacy will be the response of the European Union not only to Ukraine, but also to themselves - their future, the future of the European Union. Of course, the Russian state would not be itself if it simply watched our foreign policy success. Gas pressure on Europe is growing again. The shelling of Ukrainian positions and peaceful cities is intensifying again. Today they hit Mykolaiv, communities of the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Kharkiv region. Russian propagandists have become more active in producing fakes to provoke despair in Ukraine. But I do not believe that at least some of these fakes can work. We are defending Donbas. And, by the way, in all international contacts I hear admiration for the actions of our defenders. The world really wants to learn from Ukrainians how to fight and how to win. During the 112 days of this war, the Ukrainian army proved that courage and wisdom on the battlefield, together with the ability to tactically defeat the enemy, give significant results, even despite the significant advantage of the Russian army in the number of soldiers and equipment. Of course, we will do our best to outmatch their advantages for now. Every day I fight for Ukraine to get the necessary weapons and equipment. But courage, wisdom and tactical skills cannot be imported. Our heroes have it. I signed regular decrees awarding Ukrainian warriors. 284 servicemen were awarded state awards, 60 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who defends the state! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear Madam President of the Chamber of Deputies! Dear Prime Minister, members of the government! Dear members of the parliament, attendees, journalists! Dear Czech people! First of all, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to address both houses of the Parliament of the Czech Republic and absolutely all Czechs in this format today. I would like to thank you for those warm words, strong words of support for our people, me personally, our state, which were heard here today, and for the warmth with which you shelter our forcibly displaced persons. We appreciate it, it's truly historical. I am grateful to you for this personally and on behalf of every Ukrainian. I was thinking how to begin my speech. I will begin with words that each of you knows for sure and that all Europeans who respect history and freedom on our continent know for sure: Jsme s vámi, buďte s námi! These are words of extraordinary importance. They had such importance when they sounded on Czech radio in 1968, supporting the resistance. They are extremely important now as well, when - recalling them - we are talking about those who fought for freedom for your people. But, in fact, these words have one more dimension. Now, when the Ukrainian people are fighting for freedom against the brutal Russian invasion, we can say that it is with these words that we, Ukrainians, address all the peoples of Europe, all the peoples of the democratic world. We are with you, be with us! We oppose tyranny, which - as in the past - does not want to stop only in Ukraine. It considers everyone in Europe its target, all those who live a free life. Russia is not interested only in our cities of Mariupol, Severodonetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and Kyiv. No. Its ambitions are focused on the vast space from Warsaw to Sofia, from Prague to Tallinn. And as in the past, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is only the first step that the Russian leadership needs to open the way to other countries, to the conquest of other nations. This is openly said not only by Russian state propagandists, but also by Russian officials. They have already reached the point, for example, of threatening to officially revoke the recognition of the Baltic states' independence. And then what’s next? Who is next? Ladies and Gentlemen! When Ukraine appeals to European countries for support, we are guided by this principle, by these words that have become one of the foundations of your history: we are with you, be with us. Russian tanks storming the cities of the Ukrainian Donbas, trying to attack the Ukrainian Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, must be stopped and burned or expelled from the territory of independent Ukraine. So that they can never again come to Prague, or to Ostrava, or to Brno, or to Pilsen, or to Karlovy Vary, or to any other city on our continent. It is in Ukraine that the battle for the future of Europe is taking place right now. I am very grateful to your state, to your people for the generous help in this struggle. The Czech Republic helped us both with weapons - very substantively and immediately after it became necessary - and politically. I thank the leadership of the state for that. You can be sure that you have supported yourself and your own freedom, your own life with that. And support must be maintained for as long as it takes to win. This is how this confrontation must end - with victory. And even if some politicians in some countries are afraid of the possibility that freedom will win and tyranny will lose, there are no your leaders among such politicians. The Czech people are well aware of how compromises at the expense of others end and what concessions to tyranny lead to, which proposes to take away only the supposedly part of the desired territory to pretend that the aggression has stopped. He who wants to capture everything will never stop, taking only part. I urge you to continue together with us, without stopping for a moment, to convince all those who have not yet managed to choose a clear side in this confrontation, which has been going on for 112 days already, of this simple truth. Ukraine must get everything to win. Modern and powerful enough weapons - the Prime Minister talked about that today - to get advantage over the Russian army. Financial support - to have resources against Russia, whose savings and revenues are still very significant - in 100 days of this war since February 24 Russia has already earned 93 billion euros on the sale of energy only. Ukraine must also receive fundamental support of values that will finally deprive Russia of its main ideological weapon, namely the assertion that Europe is incapable of real unification and that it does not need Ukraine. In the near future, we must receive an answer from the European Union - from all member states - to the question of Ukraine's status. Providing Ukraine with the candidacy right now is proving that European unification is real and that European values really work and are not just defined in certain documents as a beautiful formality. The Russian troops are well aware that they are fighting against European values, against the fact that any free people of Europe who share common European values can become part of the European Union. This is the ideological firmware of the Russian occupiers. So strengthening Europe's union and saying “yes” to Ukraine is also a defense in this war. This will be another historical manifestation of the meaning contained in the words: we are with you, be with us. That is why I ask you to be as active as possible these days, these weeks, so that all European leaders agree that defending and strengthening Europe is our common cause, and so that no one can make an exception to this principle. The fateful Czech “eights”  - 1938, 1948, 1968 - are comprehensive answers to all those who still want to ""pacify"" the aggressor by betraying European values and weakening Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Czech people! The Czech presidency of the European Union will begin in a few weeks. And at this time there will be no less challenges before us, before the whole of Europe, than now. But they are transforming. I very much appreciate the key attention paid to Ukraine in the priorities of the Czech presidency. We have to agree on the seventh package of sanctions against Russia for this aggression, for this war. And we also have to substantively move on to the reconstruction of Ukraine - of the entire liberated territory. We must ensure full synchronization of the Ukrainian National Reconstruction Plan and the European Reconstruction Platform in order to implement them as efficiently and quickly as possible. I also invite you to join the reconstruction of Ukraine at the national level - taking patronage over one of the regions or cities, or communities, towns of Ukraine, which suffered from Russian aggression. Such a reconstruction will be the best proof that no aggression, no matter how brutal, will ever achieve its goals and be ever able to break any of the European nations, let alone Europe as a whole. I am grateful to you for the sincere and full support of our people, our Ukrainian temporarily displaced persons. You have sheltered hundreds of our people fleeing the war on your land. Thousands of people live in your homes, receive help from your families. We must do everything so that each and every one of them can return home, return to Ukraine. We can come - and we will come - to the fact that the principle of following the rule: ""Jsme s vámi, buďte s námi!"" - will have a result that can be described in other important words - in the words of Václav Havel: ""Truth and love have to overcome lies and hatred."" Unfortunately, this has often failed in the history of Europe. But now, in 2022, in Ukraine and, most importantly, together - we can ensure this so powerfully that the fruits of our victory will be enjoyed by many generations of our nations. Děkuji vám! Ať žije Česko! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, our air defense units managed to ""cut the wings"" of Russian missiles. Some of the missiles fired by the occupiers at our cities were shot down. And these are saved lives. This is a saved infrastructure. But we managed to shoot down only part of them. Unfortunately, there are victims, there is destruction. Today, the Lviv and Ternopil regions were hit. And we keep telling our partners that Ukraine needs modern anti-missile weapons. Our country does not have it at a sufficient level yet, but it is our country in Europe that needs such weapons most right now. Delay with its provision cannot be justified. I will constantly emphasize this when talking to our partners. We made the first requests for anti-missile systems long before the full-scale invasion. And this week there will be many different important talks - and not only with European politicians who are able to provide Ukraine with modern anti-missile systems. Even though Russia has fewer and fewer modern missiles with each passing day, Ukraine's need for such systems remains. Because Russia still has enough Soviet types of missiles, which are even more dangerous. They are many times less precise, and therefore threaten civilian objects and ordinary residential buildings much more. I spoke today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. Of course, the number one topic was defense support. Canada is among the leaders in it. I expressed gratitude for the fact that Canada became the first country to transfer special assistance to the Ukrainian account at the IMF - about $ 800 million. I also had a conversation with the President of Ecuador. I congratulated him on the election of Ecuador as a member of the UN Security Council. I informed him about the current situation on the battlefield and called for increasing pressure on Russia to end this war. Both this conversation with the President of Ecuador and yesterday's conversation with the President of Guatemala are just the beginning of our new policy of restoring relations with Latin America. Today I asked the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to be very attentive to reports in the media and on social networks that some of our fighters do not have enough personal protective equipment. The reports I receive are significantly different from what is discussed by society. And I expect inspections of logistics in the army - inspections of what is supplied and how personal protective equipment is distributed. Today, everyone in the areas of hostilities must have everything they need to protect themselves. The state provides such supplies. Over the past day no drastic changes have taken place in the battle in Donbas. The fiercest fighting is in Severodonetsk and in all cities and communities nearby - as before. The losses, unfortunately, are painful. But we have to hold on. This is our state. It is vital to hold on there, in Donbas. The more losses the enemy suffers there, the less power they will have to continue the aggression. Therefore, the Donbas direction is key to determining who will dominate in the coming weeks. We also have painful losses in the Kharkiv region, where the Russian army is trying to strengthen its position. The battles for this direction continue, and we still have to fight hard for complete security for Kharkiv and the region. We continue to put pressure on the occupiers in the south. The key goal is the liberation of Kherson, and we will move towards this step by step. I signed another decree on awarding those who excelled in battles. 63 servicemen were awarded for bravery and efficiency in defending the state. The total number of awarded is already 18,453. And such a scale, such a number of feats fully demonstrate the level of confrontation and the brutality of hostilities. I thank everyone who stood up for our state!

0,"Strong people of an unbreakable country! Today is the 110th day of our defense. And when you say that - the 110th day - you realize what a great path we have covered. The enemy was driven out of the Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions. A large part of the Kharkiv region was liberated. In total, more than a thousand settlements have been liberated. The invasion of the occupiers in the south of Ukraine was stopped. Yes, they still want to destroy Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, and the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region. They still have enough strength to shoot from the artillery at Zelenodolsk and Hulyaipole. Odesa remains a target for the Russian fleet... But dozens of the attacking attempts of the Russian army have already been thwarted right there in the south. And thanks to the counteroffensive, some communities in the Kherson region have already been liberated. In the battles in Donbas - and they will surely go down in military history as one of the most brutal battles in Europe and for Europe - the Ukrainian army and our intelligence tactically still beat the Russian military. And this is despite the significant advantage of the Russians in the amount of equipment, and especially - artillery systems. The price of this battle for us is very high. It’s just scary. And we draw the attention of our partners on a daily basis to the fact that only a sufficient number of modern artillery for Ukraine will ensure our advantage and finally the end of Russian torture of the Ukrainian Donbas. Today it became known about the death of another child caused by the Russian shelling - right there, right in Donbas, in the Luhansk region. The boy was born in 2016. He lived in Lysychansk, in an ordinary house on Moskovska Street. This is it: a six-year-old boy on Moskovska Street is also, as it turned out, a dangerous enemy for the Russian Federation... We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move on. Free our entire territory. Drive the occupiers out of all our regions. And although now the width of our front is already more than 2.5 thousand kilometers, it is felt that the strategic initiative is still ours. We will come to all our cities, to all our villages, which do not yet have our flag on the administrative buildings. Although there are a lot of Ukrainian flags there, in people’s houses, I'm sure of it. And we have already seen them when people protested against the occupiers. And we will see them again - everywhere, when we return. We will come to Kherson. And ordinary Kherson residents will meet our army on the streets of the city. The failure of the occupiers, who tried to celebrate the so-called Russia Day, only proves that Kherson is a Ukrainian city. And Kherson residents will celebrate only Ukrainian holidays. We will come to Melitopol. And we will return to all Melitopol residents the opportunity to live without fear. And, by the way, all the collaborators who are now threatening to take away land from farmers in Melitopol and other districts of Zaporizhzhia will most likely end up in this land themselves. We will come to Mariupol. And we will liberate the city for the third time. It was liberated from the Nazis in 1943 by a brilliant operation. In 2014, on this day, June 13, thanks to the courage of our ""Azov"" and other units, Mariupol was liberated for the second time. Liberated from the militants, who at that time were not yet fully aware of what the Russian state was sending them to. And now they see it all. They see burned Mariupol. They see why the Russians came there. But we will not allow them to make this city dead. We will return it. Definitely. It only takes enough weapons to make it happen. The partners have it. In sufficient quantities. And we work every day for the political will to give us these weapons to appear. We will come to Enerhodar. And I want to repeat to everyone in the city who took to the streets against the Russian military, who refuses to cooperate with the occupiers and who is waiting for us today. I want to repeat that we have not forgotten about our Enerhodar for a day. We must understand that the occupiers are keeping the occupied territory not just in an information blockade. I would call it a civilizational blockade. They are trying to make people not just know nothing about Ukraine and how we are trying to liberate our territory. They are trying to make them stop even thinking about returning to normal life, forcing them to reconcile. In some areas, the occupiers are deliberately preventing the restoration of electricity supply. In many communities, they simply blocked communication. Our television is being turned off. They closed the exit from the occupation and simply do not even allow humanitarian corridors so that we can bring people at least basic goods and medicines. And I ask everyone who has such an opportunity to communicate with people in the occupied south, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv region. Tell them about Ukraine. Tell them the truth. Say that there will be liberation. Say it to Kyrylivka, Henichesk, Berdyansk, Manhush. Say it to Horlivka, Donetsk, Luhansk. Say it to everyone in the Kharkiv region who is still forced to see the Russian flag on our Ukrainian land. Tell them that the Ukrainian army will definitely come. Of course, we will liberate our Crimea as well. The flag of Ukraine will fly again over Yalta and Sudak, over Dzhankoi and Yevpatoriya. And let every Russian official who has seized precious land in Crimea remember: this is not the land where they will have peace. There is no one today who will say exactly how long our path to victory will take. But the vast majority of people today are already aware - this is our path. This is how this war will end. We will rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. From Volnovakha to Chortkiv. Because this is Ukraine. And it is our destiny to return and strengthen it. I am proud of all our defenders! Eternal glory to you! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by the occupiers! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, friends!  Every morning I receive several informational reports. Regarding the situation on the frontline, the Russian missile strikes at Ukraine, at our people, and the number of victims of hostilities over the past day. Today, as I record this address, the report on the deceased has changed significantly. The list of killed children became longer by 24 surnames at once, and now it has 287 items. And this is probably one of the worst things that happen during a war. The Russian troops have occupied part of our country, and we do not have complete information about what is happening in the occupied areas. We do not know everything about the murders and other crimes they commit there, in the occupied part of Ukraine. We do not know what they did against our people. We do not know how many bodies the occupiers buried in mass graves or left in the ruins of destroyed cities. But gradually we learn about it. And that's how the list of killed children became 24 points longer at once - these are the children who died because of Russian strikes at Mariupol, now we know about them. The boy Maksym is among these 24 children, he was born this year; and the girl Darya, she was also born this year. Maksym and Darya did not live even three months. They died with their parents when they were all buried in the basement of an ordinary apartment building on which a Russian aircraft dropped a bomb. Tell me why is this happening in 2022? This is not the 1940s. How could mass killings, torture, burned cities, filtration camps set up by the Russian military in the occupied territories, which resemble Nazi concentration camps, become a reality? And yet Russia hopes that it will not bear responsibility for all this evil, for all these barbaric strikes at houses, hospitals and churches. Russia still has the power to hope to continue the war against Ukraine, against people and ignore the world's reaction. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am aware of your substantive help for our state. But I ask you to redouble your efforts to stop Russian hatred. Hatred for humanity. Yes, it is hatred that is the driving force of this ongoing Russian war against Ukraine and against freedom in Europe, in the world. Hatred for Ukrainian - for the culture of Ukrainians, for the history of Ukraine and for the fact that despite all the horrors of the past, Ukraine has remained a kind and open country for different cultures. Diversity is an important feature of Ukraine. What will be left of this openness, of this peaceful coexistence of different peoples? Russian shells burn even Russian churches in Ukraine. The Russian army destroyed communities in which the Greek community had lived for centuries. Crimean Tatars are the most repressed on the occupied peninsula. Russian missiles hit Babyn Yar in Kyiv, Russian artillery damaged the Menorah in Drobytsky Yar near Kharkiv. Openly anti-Semitic remarks by Russian Foreign Minister have instigated a global scandal. Is this not enough? But it is really not the 1940s now. Therefore, defend the need to enhance sanctions against Russia. You are capable of it. Help us speed up the supply of weapons to Ukraine so that we can liberate the occupied territories. We need powerful weapons for the offensive, without which the war will only drag on and the number of victims will increase. I know that your help is already significant. But you can use even more of your influence. Because we now have a historic opportunity to defend our common freedom, our common security, our common cultural diversity from the greatest wave of hatred that has threatened the world in recent decades. So, let's end this war! Let's defeat Russian hatred! In the name of children killed by the Russian army. And for the future of millions of children in Ukraine and in various European countries who deserve to live in security and peace. To just live. Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! After the missile strike at the Ternopil region, ten people are still in hospitals. There was no tactical or strategic sense in this strike, as in the vast majority of other Russian strikes. This is terror, just terror. Among the victims is a 12-year-old girl from Kharkiv. She went to the Ternopil region to flee from the Russian army. And such facts will now determine perception of Russia in the world. Not Peter I or Lev Tolstoy, but children wounded and killed by Russian strikes. Today is the 109th day of a full-scale war, but it is not the 109th day as we tell our partners a simple thing: Ukraine needs modern missile defense systems. The supply of such systems was possible this year, last year and even earlier. Did we get them? No. Do we need them? Yes. There have already been 2606 affirmative answers to this question in the form of various Russian cruise missiles that have hit Ukrainian cities. Our cities, our villages for the period from February 24. These are lives that could have been saved, these are tragedies that could have been prevented if Ukraine had been listened to. The key tactical goal of the occupiers has not changed. They are pressing in Severodonetsk, where very fierce fighting is going on - literally for every meter. And they are also pressing in the direction of Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Slovyansk and so on. The Russian army is trying to deploy reserve forces in Donbas. But what reserves can they have now? It seems that they will try to throw into battle poorly trained conscripts and those who were gathered by covert mobilization. Russian generals see their people simply as the cannon fodder they need to gain an advantage in numbers — in manpower, in military equipment. And this means only one thing: Russia can cross the line of 40,000 of its lost troops already in June. In no other war in many decades have they lost so much. I prepared an address to the American Jewish Committee. A global forum organized by the committee began in New York today. This is one of the most influential structures that helps promote decisions for our protection. I called on them to redouble their efforts so that we could get more modern weapons, more financial support for our state, so that we could end this war sooner. This week I will continue to address the parliaments of the partner countries, in particular the parliament of the Czech Republic. Many talks of various levels with European politicians are also planned. We work every day with the European Union on the candidate status for Ukraine, and our state has done everything for a positive response. The only question is the determination of some European leaders. We will continue to work to facilitate access of Ukrainian goods to all important markets around the world. Customs duties on trade with the European Union have already been abolished. The United States already applies a duty-free regime for Ukrainian steel. Canada has abolished customs duties. The same regime will work in the near future with Britain. We expect trade liberalization from Australia. The Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization has started today. Before it began, representatives of 57 countries gathered for a special event of solidarity with Ukraine, and I am grateful to them - to each and everyone - for that. And as a result of this intergovernmental conference, we will learn, in particular, the timing of the decision on trade liberalization for Ukraine from Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland. So the week will be significant. And I believe that there will be good news for Ukraine. I am grateful to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, CORE and all the participants of this charity evening! 107 days ago, Russia launched a full-scale war against us. All of you have heard about the horrors that Ukraine is going through. Tens of thousands of explosions and shots. Hundreds of thousands wounded and killed. Millions who have lost their homes. All of this is not a logline for a horror film. All of this is our reality. All of you have seen photos from Ukraine. Peaceful cities and villages wiped off the face of the earth. All of this is not the scenery of a blockbuster about the apocalypse. All of this is our reality. All of you have seen footage from Ukraine. Cruise missiles and bombs that raze schools, hospitals, theaters, museums, entire streets and neighborhoods to the ground. It is not VFX, not computer graphics. All of this is our reality. But definitely we will rebuild Ukraine. Streets and neighborhoods, peaceful cities and villages. We will heal bodies from wounds and souls from losses. All of this is not a synopsis of a fiction film. All of this is our reality and our future. And all of you can help us in this. You were ready to melt your Oscar in protest against the lack of support to Ukraine. I hope that this will not be necessary. Other metal must melt. Weapons of barbarians, which kill civilians, women, the elderly and small children, must melt. The aggressor’s equipment, its tanks, planes, ships, rockets and all other iron that brings evil must melt. We have been resisting it for 107 days in a row. We can stop it together. Support Ukraine because Ukraine supports the whole world. Fight for Ukraine because Ukraine is fighting for the whole world. For democracy. For freedom. For life! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"I wish health to all Ukrainians and all our friends! The final phase of the big diplomatic marathon, which is to end in a week and a half, has started today. And in this marathon we are actually together with the European Union - in one team, and this team has to win. I am sure that we will soon receive an answer on the candidate status for Ukraine. I am convinced that this decision can strengthen not only our state, but also the entire European Union. What else needs to happen in Europe to make it clear to skeptics that the very fact of keeping Ukraine outside the European Union works against Europe? For example, everything is already obvious to the Russian occupiers. They say so when they torment our people that it is allegedly for the fact that Ukraine has gone to Europe. And why does Europe have skeptics then? We will continue to work even harder at all levels to get the right decision. It is very important for us. Very fruitful talks with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen were held in Kyiv today. I am pleased to note her sincerity. It is the European Commission that will prepare a conclusion regarding our application. Ukraine provided all the necessary answers in a very short time, and it was done well. There will be many more equally important and, I hope, fruitful talks with European leaders next week. I talked to the participants of a very representative security forum in Asia, in Singapore. High level. The event was attended by defense ministers and other high-ranking officials from dozens of countries of the region. We really need this region. And I felt that today my address was heard there, arguments were heard and perceived. News about the distribution of Russian passports in Kherson and the distribution of passports in Melitopol were actively spread in the occupied territories and in Russia. And I looked at who in this news was shown as Kherson and Melitopol residents who allegedly want Russian passports. A few collaborators and people from their entourage... Well, it looked like not a queue to get a passport, but an attempt to get a ticket to flee. Very demonstrative. The Ukrainian troops are gradually liberating the territory of the Kherson region. Today the village of Tavriis'ke has been added to the list of returned settlements of our state. There is certain success in the Zaporizhzhia region as well. Fierce street battles continue in Severodonetsk. I am proud of all our defenders who managed to stop the advance of these hostile people, these occupiers for many weeks already and keep our defense strong. Do you remember how Russia hoped to capture the entire Donbas in early May? It is already the 108th day of the war, it is already June. Donbas is holding on. The losses suffered by the occupiers, including in this area, are extremely significant. In total, the Russian army today has about 32,000 dead souls. For what? What did it give you, Russia? No one can say now how long this burning of souls by Russia will last. But we must do everything to make the occupiers regret that they have done all this, and to hold them accountable for every murder and every strike at our beautiful state. Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear participants of the Shangri-La Dialogue forum! Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. When I was preparing for this meeting with you - so far a virtual meeting, but I hope for live meetings during my visits to your region after our victory in the war - so when I was preparing for this meeting, I was told about a girl. She wrote me a letter asking to support her initiative called Spray Paint Ukraine. This is an initiative to help Ukraine. She created this image, but an NFT image, and gave me this T-shirt so I could wear it, and thus help everyone know about her initiative. And I thought that this situation - this girl's appeal, her idea, her confidence that the President of Ukraine can respond to her initiative, as well as the fact that I am really ready to help - will be important. I wore this T-shirt today. And this may help explain why Ukraine has gained such support in the world and why we will definitely win this war that Russia has started. Can you imagine, for example, the President of Russia, who would respond to the initiative of a girl from your country, to such an initiative? Who would just see a letter of appeal to the Embassy in Singapore to support the idea of a girl unknown to him and wear a T-shirt sent to him? I think this is impossible at all. And that's what really happens. This is the confrontation between ""possible"", which we and many others in the world need, and ""impossible"", for which Russia is desperately fighting. Russia wants to make it impossible for a neighboring country, which it sees solely as its colony, to be able to exist freely, to exist independently. That is why the Russian army has already killed tens of thousands of our people, deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to its territory. Russia has already used 2,595 cruise missiles against us alone - and that's in 108 days! Russia wants to make it impossible for our land, resources and water to be used in the interests of our people. It wants to steal all this, and is actively looting the territory it managed to occupy. Absolutely everything is taken from there - from cars left on the streets and in the yards to equipment of the seized factories, from scrap metal to grain. Just imagine the meanness of the Russian Federation if its representatives stole even a few trolleybuses from our city of Mariupol, which was completely destroyed by the Russian army. This is the ""great Russia"" - stealing trolleybuses. It wants to make it impossible for the nations of the world to be confident in the freedom of navigation. In this basic freedom for peace and prosperity in any region of the planet. From the first minutes of the full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia blocked our ports in the Black Sea using its fleet. During the war, the Russian military attacked, in particular, peaceful merchant ships, and also fired missiles at our port infrastructure. Today, the Black Sea is the most dangerous sea in the world. And this is solely Russia's fault. Although on February 23 this year, on the eve of the war, free and safe navigation was possible in the Black Sea. I can cite such examples for a very long time - examples of what Russia wants to make impossible. I am sure that in many of these examples you will be able to see what is valuable to you. What makes your life the life you value. And I am convinced that you are all interested in the possible free and independent life of your nations, the preservation of your culture, your material and resource wealth. So that no one robs your property, so that your cultural treasures are not taken away. So that no enemy fleet can make your seas dangerous for navigation. Russian propaganda is trying hard to spread in your countries, as in many others, the disinformation thesis that Russia's war against Ukraine is allegedly something about NATO, about the role of America, about the West's attempts to advance somewhere in Europe. But Russia's war against Ukraine is far from just about Europe. It's about globally important things. The Russian leadership wants to reject all the achievements of human history, including the system of international law that we have today, and return to life as in the XIX century or even earlier.  When everything that gave billions of people a chance for harmonious development and prosperity was impossible. That is why I want to remind you of the words of a man you all know well: ""If there was no international law and a big fish ate a small one and a small one ate a shrimp, we would not exist."" These are the very wise words of Lee Kuan Yew, a leader who could see the real causes of many things and processes and who knew what should really be appreciated. And that's why I'm in this T-shirt now, that's why I responded to the request of a girl from Singapore. We must value our opportunities. We must appreciate what has been made possible by the wise leadership in the past, by the struggle of many generations of various nations. We must appreciate what gives us the chance to live in peace and work for the common good in our societies and in the world. Hence, we must stop Russia. We must stop the war that this state has started against my state, trying to return the world to the old days, when the freedom of nations and people's lives did not matter. We must break the ability of Russia or any other country in the world to block the seas, to destroy the freedom of navigation. If sanctions, then sanctions. If mirror measures to limit the service of Russian ships in ports, then mirror measures. Russia must feel that its aggressive policy has consequences primarily for itself. And if this does not happen, if the Russian blockade prevents us from continuing to export our food, which the global market currently lacks, the world will face a severe food crisis and famine in many countries in Asia and Africa. Food shortages will inevitably be followed by political chaos, which could lead to the fall of many governments and disaster for many politicians. And you can already see how this catastrophe is approaching, just by looking at rising prices for basic products on the world market and in some countries. This is a direct consequence of Russia's actions. Finally, we must return full force to international law. Since February 24, 287 children have died in Ukraine as a result of Russian strikes. And that's just what we know officially. We do not yet know how many people were buried in mass graves in the occupied territories and how many bodies remained in the ruins of houses in cities still controlled by the Russian army. For murder and torture, for deportations, for destroyed cities, for the use of illicit munitions, including phosphorus bombs, for blackmail with chemical and nuclear weapons - for all this, any state, not just Russia, must be held accountable. And we can make it possible! If we act in a coordinated manner. Although Russia, of course, will try to make it impossible. We can ensure UN reform. So that all states abide by international law, so that no one violates the world order. The UN system and, in particular, the UN Security Council today do not provide a fair representation for most nations of the world. The voices of entire regions of the planet often cannot be heard when it is vital. If this reform had already taken place, we today would be able to respond to any aggression - not just that of Russia - at a truly global level. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am grateful to you for supporting Ukraine. I am grateful to you for your attention to our state. But remember that this support and attention is not only for Ukraine, but also for yourself. For making your future secure. It is on the battlefield in Ukraine that it is being decided what rules the world will live by and what will be possible and what will be impossible. Let's save the world from going back to the days when everything was decided on the basis of the so-called right of force, and individuals and any of their ideas, like many nations, simply did not matter.

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! A brief report on the passing day. By the way, it is the 107th day of our defense already. Very fierce fighting continues in Donbas. I repeat these names every day: Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Slovyansk, many, many others. I repeat them at meetings with the military, with diplomats, talking to representatives of partner countries. Russia wants to destroy every city in Donbas, “every” is not an exaggeration. Like Volnovakha, like Mariupol. All these ruins in once happy cities, black traces of fires, craters from explosions - this is all that Russia can give to its neighbors, Europe and the world. This is probably the fastest example of the complete degradation of any state - the path that the Russian state has covered in 107 days. The Ukrainian troops are doing everything to stop the offensive of the occupiers. As much as possible. As much as the heavy weapons, modern artillery - all that we have asked and continue to ask our partners for - allow them to. I met in Kyiv with Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom Ben Wallace. We talked exactly about this – how to stop Russian aggression, how to deprive it of offensive potential, what other supplies are needed for our army. The Britons demonstrate true leadership in defense matters. I also addressed the British university community today and talked to students. I work at all levels so that the world can hear us and know what we need. There were many questions from students about what our life would be like after this war. About reconstruction, attracting leading experts, about the education system. Of course, we are preparing for a large-scale restoration of our state. Of course, we have already started reconstruction in the liberated territory. Of course, we will change a lot in our lives after this war. And it is good that the world is interested in details, they want to join, they are thinking how to find opportunities to work for Ukraine after our victory. But the battles are still going on. And right now, in these very difficult battles, it is being decided when this ""after"" will come. It is being decided at which frontiers we will finally break the plans of the occupiers. And everyone should remind societies in other countries of this. Of the battles that are going on now. Of the support that is needed now. It depends not only on politicians and diplomats. But also on journalists, activists, entrepreneurs, our displaced persons who are abroad. Now is the time that all Ukrainians must be one - a nation that is fighting and does not allow the world to divert its attention away from what is happening on the battlefield in Ukraine. I also addressed the participants of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit today. I spoke, in particular, about the response of the European Union, which we expect for our application for candidacy. I will emphasize again and again: this will be the EU's response not only to Ukraine, but also to its own future - the future of the European project. I am grateful to the British Government, the World Bank and the Government of Canada for new steps in financial support for Ukraine. The day before, our country received 1.5 billion US dollars: one billion is the World Bank, another 500 million is Britain. Direct budget support. We will use it to pay salaries in the public sector. Canada, for its part, became the first country to send 1 billion Canadian dollars to our administrative account in the IMF. The Government of Ukraine has already started implementing the decisions discussed at this week's meetings. A bill has been approved that will allow customs clearance of cars through the state service in ""Diia"". The whole process of customs clearance will be fully transparent, convenient and immediately remove all the shadow schemes that were possible in previous years in this area. I hope that the people's deputies of Ukraine will quickly vote for such a step. Also today, the government has already presented specific details of new state programs that should provide new jobs and support for business in this very difficult time for all of us. This applies in particular to non-repayable grants for micro-businesses and other special financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Despite all the pressure from Russia, despite all the Russian strikes, we will do everything to revive Ukraine's economy, economic activity. In the evening I signed two decrees awarding our heroes. In total, 242 combatants were awarded, eight of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

Yes, it's just a beautiful, symbolic fact, and I'll be honest: it doesn't do much for this speech. I could compare the present in Ukraine with a difficult boat race: against the current, waves and storm, where our state is ""steering"", sails to freedom, opposes the Russian warship, and it is important for us to feel that we are not alone. That all the countries of the free world are in one boat. And Ukraine doesn’t have to send an SOS signal to everyone on the 107th day of the war! I could say more, but I'll be honest: I don't want this speech to last 16 minutes 19 seconds. Although, again, I'll be honest: it had every chance to be such. Preparing for the meeting, I read a lot about the history and traditions of your educational institutions. To speak one language with you. To tell about the present of Ukraine very clearly and understandably for each and every one of you. For 107 days in a row, Ukraine and our people have heroically opposed Russian aggression. For many, our steadfastness has become a mystery and almost a miracle. Just as the Oxford Electric Bell and its design - it is still unknown exactly how it works. So is Ukraine, which for 107 days in a row has been continuously generating energy that resists the world's second army and defending itself and Europe, and if Ukraine runs out of battery, this will be a real energy crisis on the planet. For 107 days in a row we have been passing the survival exam. Every day we seem to be passing the Cambridge Tripos. On a chair with three legs, under the roar of an air-raid siren. For 107 days in a row, Ukraine has been resisting barbarians, savages, dementors. The army of ""he-who-must-not-be-named"", according to some politicians. Even more so it is inadmissible to refuse to buy oil, gas, etc. from him. For 107 days we have been facing the enemy who has not read one of the founders of the London School of Economics - Bernard Shaw. Who does not recognize the worldview that now that we have learned to fly the air like birds, swim under water like fish, we lack one thing – to learn to live on earth as human beings! The enemy who does not recognize the truth, for which the rector of the University of Birmingham, Nobel Peace Prize winner and architect of the League of Nations Robert Cecil fought. About the vital need for humanity to resolve conflicts not in the trenches, but at the table. The advantage of arguments, not missiles. For 107 days in a row, we have been opposing a state that is suffering from a new form of color blindness. It calls black white, and white black. It declares peaceful goals, but makes peaceful cities and villages its target, killing women and children, calling it self-defense. 80 years ago, Manchester survived the Christmas Blitz. This spring, the whole of Ukraine survived the Easter Blitz. 80 years ago, the Nazis razed Coventry. This year, the ruscists created dozens of new coventries in Ukraine. These are Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Kharkiv, Mariupol. For 107 days in a row, we have been opposing a nuclear power that deserves the wooden spoon for ignorance of international law and the Darwin Award for violating it. As you can see, I was completely honest when I said that I was seriously preparing for our conversation. Is irony and humor appropriate on my part in such times? It can’t be otherwise. Impossible. I could cite many more analogies, quote hundreds of worthy graduates of your universities, but honestly I’d rather ask: what do you know about us? Recently, students at the University of Edinburgh exposed their professor for spreading Russian propaganda and lies while lecturing on the war in Ukraine. Excuse me for the tautology. Such news, like hundreds of other signals we see and hear from you, testify to at least three things. You are not indifferent to the war in Ukraine, lies about this war are noticeable and disgusting, but the truth is known, necessary and important. At the same time, you know the truth about Ukraine and the war. You know about Ukraine because of the war. You read about the shelling of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Mariupol. But did you know that these cities are sister cities of Leeds, Birmingham, Liverpool? Have you heard of the Kyivan Letter? A document of the times of Ukraine-Rus’, which is more than 1000 years old, which is stored in the Cambridge Library? About Queen Margaret, the first Saint of Scotland, granddaughter of the Grand Duke of Kyiv Yaroslav the Wise. Have you heard about the founder of Donetsk - Welsh engineer John Hughes. Or about the founder of Luhansk - Scotsman Charles Gascoigne, who built the first coal mine in Ukraine. The point is not that we have common pages of history. I'm not trying to surprise anyone with this right now. The point is that this is perhaps the best description of the essence of the war that Russia is waging against us. Its goal is to erase our history, to erase our statehood, our identity, to deny our existence as such. To say that we never existed. That we are an artificially created people, as if we are not humans, but a variety of plants or a species of animals. To devalue our culture, to humiliate our language, to cross out our art. Our musicians, writers, philosophers, scientists, designers, inventors, all the great rulers and all the great warriors of Kyivan Rus’, Zaporizhzhian Sich, who existed, exist and will exist. Russia's goal is to erase all associations about Ukraine except the war. Ukraine without the past, without the bright moments of the present, and therefore without the right to the future. Why, you may ask, is Russia doing this? Because it has a global phobia at the state level. This is a phobia of freedom. For them, this is an unfamiliar, unknown, and therefore very frightening force. Even if freedom is not in their country, but in a neighboring country. Freedom is nearby. For Russia, it is dangerously close. It wants to destroy it. But it will lose. We are fighting for our future, they are fighting for someone else's past. But the time of such countries and rulers has passed. And our time is our time, this is the future. And this is an active voice. Real voice. Voice of truth, honor, wisdom and freedom. And let's talk to you with this voice today! I do not want this speech to last 16 minutes 19 seconds. So let's finally begin! And to be honest I will be very honest. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear attendees! Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the opportunity to address you. Last year, at the Fourth Copenhagen Democracy Summit, the question arose as to where the frontline between freedom and oppression lies and how to protect freedom from authoritarianism. Well, this year we got the answer to this question not just in discussions, but on the battlefield. This year has shown that the state border of Ukraine is an actual line of confrontation. But between what and what? Just between freedom and oppression? Or just between democracy and authoritarianism? Yes, between them. But this confrontation can also be viewed from another point of view. It can be assessed not only in terms of political regimes or ideologies. It also needs to be looked at in terms of the ability to turn a word into action. This is the fundamental ability of any system - public, state, business. If this ability is not lacking, the system loses. Of course, we are all raised in cultures that value the word. And the democratic system is always based on the fact that the word matters. And I do not want to underestimate the importance of discussions, opinions, and positions. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it didn’t take much time for one system to turn words about a people that allegedly does not exist into brutal hostilities aimed at destroying that people. Or to turn the words that some territory is supposed to be part of another state into action to capture this territory. Can democratic systems help this nation that becomes a victim of aggression as quickly as tyranny starts aggression? Does the democratic world have the tools to defend this territory, which someone there has decided to seize, just as quickly? Last year, at a summit like this, such words could be the basis for an interesting discussion about the power of Europe and Russian tyranny. But this year we see that these are absolutely practical questions on which the fate of millions of people directly depends - and, in fact, not only in Ukraine. Because the Russian state is interested in a much larger territory than the sovereign territory of Ukraine, and Russia does not recognize the right to independent existence not only of the Ukrainian people. Ladies and Gentlemen! Let's take a closer look at some words that have not yet turned into action. The word is always the basis of the law. This is always the basis of the treaty. Conventions, statutes, declarations and, of course, memoranda. During the Russian war against Ukraine alone - and it has been going on, I will remind you, not since February 24, but since 2014 - Russia has violated about four hundred different international treaties to which our states are parties. Here are just a few examples: UN Charter; UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; Corpus of conventions governing the laws and customs of war; International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict; UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. From key global documents we can move to fundamental ones for Europe. The Russian state violated: CSCE Final Act 1975; European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Statute of the Council of Europe. And we should all recall the Budapest Memorandum, the violation of which by Russia adds maximum cynicism to this picture. With this violation, Russia has put an end to the entire struggle for nuclear disarmament in the world. What is the point of talking about nuclear disarmament now that Ukraine, whose third-largest nuclear arsenal has been taken away, has been attacked by a state that was among those who signed a pledge to refrain from aggression and still remains a nuclear state? Democracy is always respect for words. International law is also respect for words. But they work and are able to win in confrontations only when they can be backed up by action. When a word literally means action. So, returning to the question of where the line of confrontation between freedom and oppression lies, it is worth saying that it also lies between the ability to simply say something and the willingness to act to reinforce certain words - promises to voters, words in negotiations and texts of conventions. On the Ukrainian border, in the Ukrainian Donbas, near Kharkiv, in the south of Ukraine, we can now see that the Ukrainian people are really ready to back up their words about independence with appropriate actions in defense of independence. But where is the frontier where it will be seen that Europe is also ready to back up all the words important for it with appropriate action? If polls show that 71 percent of Europeans consider Ukraine part of the European family, why are there still political skeptics who are hesitant to allow us to move to the European Union? If Europe's core values imply that every nation has the same importance and should be equally respected, why have the Ukrainian people been told for so long that they must remain in the gray zone between the European Union and Russia? If Russia cynically violates literally all vital documents of international law, why are there still those who are hesitant to block any relations with such a state? These questions indicate, in fact, that the European system can lose if words are not backed up by action. A democratic system can lose even on our continent if there is no action. So, first of all, we need to finally remove this gray zone, which is so tempting for the Russian state. We need to move from words that Ukraine is part of the European family to action. In the coming weeks, the European Union can take a historic step that will prove that the words about the Ukrainian people's belonging to the European family are not empty. Secondly, there is a need for effective, legally binding security guarantees in a renewed security architecture for the European continent. We are currently working on such a system of guarantees for Ukraine. And only when it appears can we say with confidence that the thousands of words on the pages of conventions, statutes, treaties and memoranda are not just words, but a reality backed up by action. We must also finally learn to act preventively. Not just to react, but to act as soon as words of aggression are heard. When it becomes clear that the war can start at any moment. The aggressor must feel the power of the democratic world, the power of international law as soon as he intends to violate the existing basic norms. And the third mandatory point is that all war criminals must always be held accountable. Justice must have its say. And the word of justice must be backed up by action. For every death inflicted in Ukraine by Russian soldiers, for every torture and rape, for every city destroyed, for the deportation of people and children, both those who did it directly and those Russian commanders and politicians who gave such orders must be held accountable. Democracy must be effective - in every sense. Europe must be effective. If words are said, if they were put on paper and became documents of international law, they must work. They must act. And when that happens, there will be no question of who will win and where this frontline is. Of course, democracy. Of course, Europe. And above all in the minds of leaders who must act, not just speak. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians!  All our defenders! I have recently finished a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron. We talked primarily about defense support. Of course, this is a key topic. I informed Emmanuel about the situation on the frontline, about the possible development of confrontation in the coming days and weeks, about the intentions of the Russian occupiers and about our resistance. Of course, we talked in detail about Ukraine's European perspective. We are preparing for a response to our application for candidacy. The issues of security guarantees for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe were also touched upon. I am grateful that we discussed this topic with the President of France. We continue our work. I also spoke today with the Prime Minister of Montenegro about the path of our countries to the European Union. In fact, we exchanged experience. We continue very active work in all the countries of the European Union on a daily basis, so that the situation regarding the candidacy for our country is equally perceived there - in the west, in the east, in the north and in the south of the European Union. Most Europeans support Ukraine's integration. And if Europeans support it, politicians who are still skeptical in some countries should not oppose themselves to the people, society and the very course of European history. I addressed the participants of the ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It is one of the most influential international organizations in the world. They severed ties with Russia. But substantial decisions are also needed - we need concrete pressure on Russia for what it is doing, including the crisis it has provoked in the world food market. I held a very important meeting with government officials today. Economy, business, jobs. We discussed actions at three levels - what needs to be done right now, what we can do in the near future, no matter how difficult it is, and what we will definitely do after the war. The first is a program of special grants to support small and medium-sized businesses. What can already provide new jobs and a new tax base. The second is the development of our security sector in all its aspects. Both now and in the future. It is also a question of jobs, a question of professionalism and technologies. The security sector in Ukraine must become completely different from what it has been all these 30 years. From the state border to every street, to every school, to every infrastructure object - security must be 100% ensured. And the third aspect is industrial recovery and attracting investment to the state. Localization, industrial parks, support of the state order, attraction of modern technologies to Ukraine. Relevant state programs are being prepared. There are many discussions in Ukraine today about what the economic policy of the state should be both during the war and when we restore peace. I want to emphasize one detail. And this detail is fundamental. We have to get used to the fact that there can be only two parts of society - those who defend our independence and those who work in a way to ensure that defense. And this is not a question of one or another economic doctrine, not a question of one or another political position. We simply cannot afford to leave the shadow part of economic life in the country. Of course, I understand that in some of our regions now, any economic activity - official or nonofficial - is a matter of mere survival. But if we talk about the normal, stable and strong life of society, the work of the state, our defense, we must understand: there are those who serve, and there are those who provide with their work those who serve. So, this is official employment. This is the payment of taxes. This is the maximum expansion of economic opportunities in our country on legal grounds. And this is a complete modernization of state institutions. Everyone who works in Ukrainian politics, who influences the public debate, should realize that there will be no more shadow in the country. I am grateful to our communication workers, who today resumed television broadcasting in Kharkiv after the morning shelling literally within a day. Striking at TV centers, destroying communication channels, leaving people in isolation - these are the tactics of the occupiers, which they really cannot do without. Because openness and honesty are also weapons against everything that the Russian state brings. The frontline situation today is without significant changes. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and other cities in Donbas, which the occupiers now consider key targets, are holding on. We have a certain positive in the Zaporizhzhia region, where we manage to thwart the plans of the occupiers. We are gradually moving forward in the Kharkiv region, liberating our land. We are keeping defense in the Mykolaiv direction. I am grateful to all our defenders who made this possible. Thanks to which we have endured 106 days of full-scale war already. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen! I am glad to have an opportunity to address you today. Today - when the world is in the midst of several global crises: the food crisis, the energy crisis and the crisis of values - I would use this very concept to describe a crisis that is often called geopolitical. Values. And I will explain later why this is so. A year ago - in the same summer time as now - when these three crises were being prepared, and were being prepared directly by Russia, the world did not want to see where it was heading. It did not want to see how much could depend on the development of the situation here in our part of Europe. Russia's war against Ukraine and, more broadly, Russia's aggression against all the rules of life in Europe and the world have had dire consequences. Tens of thousands of people have been killed. Hundreds of cities and villages in Ukraine have been destroyed. About 12 million people in Ukraine have become displaced persons, reflecting the biggest migrant crisis in Europe since World War II. The Black Sea, which is one of the key routes for food exports, is blocked by the Russian navy. Hundreds of millions of people on different continents are on the brink of at least food shortages and at most famine for which Russia will be fully responsible. Europe is experiencing one of the most difficult energy situations in its history... And we do not yet know what other crises Russia is preparing for the free world. What will happen if the Russian army uses weapons of mass destruction? What will happen if as a result of Russian strikes a threat will emerge, for example, to drinking water sources in our region? Or a threat of radiation or chemical pollution of the Black Sea basin, and hence parts of the Mediterranean? When Ukraine warned the world about Russian preparations last year and stressed the need for tough preventive sanctions against Russia, so that Moscow would at least feel that any aggression would not go unpunished, the world did not hear us. When we said that Russia's policy of energy conquering of Europe was aimed at creating problems not only for Ukraine - and our gas transportation system - but also for all Europeans, it was not fully perceived by some leaders in Europe itself. And when we warned that Russia's aggressive actions to block free navigation in the Sea of Azov would lead to much greater negative consequences, many in the world simply did not want to believe it and openly said that it was allegedly impossible. But all this is not just possible. That's what happened. And this is because Russia was not shown in time that the world can be tough when it comes to defending common interests. Basic interests - peace, security, freedom, free trade and predictability of life. Ladies and Gentlemen! For a long time, the world has not recognized the importance of Ukraine and the weight of our warnings. But Russia has always known that a few steps against our state, a few steps in our region - and the consequences will be felt on all continents. That is why Russia needs control over Ukraine. That is why it is the basic interest of the world now to help protect Ukraine. Russia's war against our state must end as soon as possible so that the security of food supplies across the Black Sea can be guaranteed. Because it is Ukrainian agricultural exports that play a stabilizing role in the global market. And Russia must be held accountable for provoking a new wave of migration against Europe, using the people of both Africa and Asia simply as hostages. For this, long-term painful sanctions must be applied against Russia at the global level. There can also be no question of Russia's continued membership in the FAO – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. What has Russia to do there if it is working for starvation of at least four hundred million and at most more than a billion people? We need to guarantee Ukraine's long-term security as soon as possible so that we can guarantee Europe's long-term energy security and replace Russian fossil fuels on our continent through green energy transformation and green hydrogen. And, of course, we need to start the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine as soon as possible to ensure that none of the environmental threats posed by Russia during the war against Ukraine hit our people and neighboring nations. The Ukrainian Donbas, which Russia is simply destroying with brutal missile, air and artillery strikes, has been one of the world's most prominent industrial regions. And these are deep coal mines, metallurgical and chemical enterprises. Any hostilities in such a region - and even more so with the use of weapons now used by Russia - is a threat of pollution to a vast area. Threat of pollution of groundwater and rivers, and hence the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Just imagine the level of losses - for Europe and the world. Ladies and Gentlemen! At the beginning, I said that the world was in a crisis of values. In what way is it reflected? There are no such governments and countries, no international organizations that do not understand the global threats of Russian aggression. But there are governments, countries, and international organizations that believe they may sit out and not react to what is happening. This is a problem of values, not geopolitics. They talk about geopolitics when they don't want to admit that they are giving up values. I am grateful to you for remaining principled. For the fact that you are really willing to defend values. Because it is on the basis of values that sustainable development and sustainability of progress are possible. This was the right decision - when you terminated all cooperation with Russia and stopped the process of Russia's accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, when you closed the Organization's office in Moscow. And this should be an example for other international organizations. We must continue to use all instruments of pressure on Russia, both at the level of international organizations and at the level of countries, to stop its aggressive policy. The world must remove everything that hinders cooperation and development, and Russian aggression is the first key obstacle, the first key threat. And I believe that in the near future we will be able to begin to use in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine all the experience of the OECD, which is based on the implementation of the historically significant Marshall Plan. I am grateful for the decision to open a regional office of the Organization in Kyiv, our capital. This is the recognition of the importance of our country, our region for global cooperation and development. Thank you for your attention!  Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and gentlemen!  Greetings from Ukraine! And thank you for the opportunity to address you. When I learnt that I was named the most influential person of the year, I took it as a recognition of what all of our people are doing – all Ukrainians who are defending the freedom and independence of our state. And I am honored to be a leader, above all, for these people. Besides myself, this year’s top five features Elon Musk, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, medical workers who fought with COVID, and President of the United States Joe Biden. This ranking of the most influential is made at a time when Europe is experiencing the worst war in 77 years. The war we cannot stop yet. Why so? Why cannot we stop the bloodshed? Why is our influence not working at full capacity? And why is a person who is not on our list at all holding millions of people hostage? I believe you will agree that these questions are now literally hanging in the air. But do you have the answers? The runner-up of our top list is Elon Musk. A man who launches rockets into space and knows how to amaze the world. A man who pushes the boundaries of the possible for both intelligence and technology. But the opinions of world leaders are not focused on Elon. Not on his rockets, which ensure progress in life. Opinions of world leaders are dedicated to those who launch rockets at civilians and destroy lives. In 105 days of the full-scale war, Russia has used about 2,600 different missiles against Ukrainian cities, most of them against civilian facilities: enterprises, railways, bridges, universities, even residential buildings. One of such rockets killed three people in our city of Odesa at once: a three-month-old girl named Kira, her mother and grandmother. Three generations of one family. Kira was only a month old when Russia started a full-blown war. What did she see in her life? And what did her assassination add to Russia’s influence? At the beginning of this war, I spoke with Elon. He asked me what he could do to help. And help he did. Thanks to his technologies, we can provide our people with a stable connection even when Russian missiles destroy all infrastructure. But are there any world leaders who are worried about whether or not Elon will pick up the phone when they call him? Or, those worried whether he will accept them? Are there leaders who think about how long the table will be when Elon Musk sits down to talk to them? So what does the influence really give? What rockets? Those that serve science? Or those that serve death? Something has definitely slipped out of control. Whether it's our own influence, which we began to underestimate, or our attitude to leadership. Attitude to what it means to be a leader. I have so much respect for Boris Johnson. He is a true friend of Ukraine and a strong defender of freedom. But, unfortunately, not all depends on him whether millions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America will have food on their tables. It is the Russian fleet – not the British one or any other – that has blocked Ukraine’s Black Sea ports so that the world is on the brink of a terrible food crisis. And it's not simply a price crisis. We cannot export our wheat, corn, vegetable oil and other products that have played a stabilizing role in the global market. This means that, unfortunately, dozens of countries may face a physical shortage of food. Millions of people may starve if Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea continues. We are constantly talking to Boris and other leaders on how to lift the Russian blockade of our ports. And how to restore the freedom of navigation – one of the basic freedoms for all humankind. But while we are looking for ways to protect freedom, another person is destroying it. Another person continues to blackmail the world with hunger. He is another in every sense of the word. Particularly, in the way this person is fighting for influence. And I have a question: why is this “otherness” still acceptable to certain leaders and countries? I leave this question to you. Because, in fact, everyone has to answer it – first of all, for themselves. To feel deep inside what is called values. Do they exist? It is only fair that the medical workers who fought against COVID have been noted this year in the Time vote. They really are the heroes of their time. And with their conscientious work, they have encouraged the whole world to unite. Finally to unite. At first, people in different countries thought that it was enough to just close the borders and provide themselves – themselves first – with the vaccine. But later it became clear that COVID-19 has no borders and cannot be dealt with only within national borders. Even the most advanced healthcare systems were not ready for the virus. And, unfortunately, had to go through a grievous injustice, fighting with COVID-19 to find a vaccine. To agree on common rules of response, a global mechanism for the distribution of vaccines. Why is this happening again? Why is it so difficult again? Weapons and sanctions are also a vaccine. A vaccine against COVID-22 brought by Russia. Hatred is a virus, and it's even more deadly than COVID-19. It is spread through propaganda. Thanks to the impunity for murderers. Thanks to Russian oil, which is still on the global market. Thanks to money that is still flowing between the global financial system and Russian banks. Thanks to the big companies, which still believe that there is still not enough blood on the money from the Russian market. Although tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced to flee their homes because of this war. When hatred knocks on your door, will you be ready? Will any face mask protect you from the Russian COVID-22? And why is the vaccine against it – weapons and sanctions – so difficult to get in sufficient quantities? Why do some countries pretend as if COVID-22 does not exist, just like conspiracy theorists for whom there was no COVID-19? Why do some people learn nothing even from blood and death? I am grateful to President Biden for uniting the free world when the Russian threat arose. Today we have different tools to respond. These are defense support for Ukraine, financial aid and political coordination among many countries. It is also the Lend-Lease, which brings back the meaning of the struggle for freedom that was relevant during World War II. Because the current threat is similar in scale. However, Russia’s war against Ukraine is still ongoing. And right now, as you are listening to my address, the Ukrainian military are dying on the battlefield. The Russian army is shelling our cities with artillery and aircraft. The list of children killed by Russian strikes since February 24 already includes more than two hundred and sixty names. And when will this end? In fact, this is the key question. But why is there still no answer? Why is our influence not enough for this? Are we cowards? No. Maybe we are missing something in our true strength? Maybe we are not using all the capacity of our influence and our leadership? And this is my question to the United States, both to the parties and to society; to both Democrats and Republicans; to the Congress and to the President. It is time to be one hundred percent influential. We can defeat tyranny. Indeed, every one of us – every one – is the leader of our time. We can reliably defend freedom. We can stop blackmail by a person who has no place on our list at all. If we are up to it, then we must do it. Because influence obliges us to do so. Thank you!  Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Exactly 10 years ago, this day marked the start of EURO 2012, the European Football Championship, which brought together all Ukrainians, Ukrainians and Poles, Ukrainians and the vast majority of Europeans. The opening ceremony was in Warsaw, the final ceremony was in our capital, Kyiv. The matches were hosted in different cities of our two countries and in particular in Donetsk, at the Donbas Arena. Only 10 years have passed - and it seems that it was in another world. Just today, the occupiers announced the absolutely crazy news that they are preparing to unite some football clubs from all occupied territories into one pseudo-championship - from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Melitopol, Crimea, and even part of Georgia. It's just a mockery of the occupiers over people who remember everything well. 10 years ago our Donetsk was a strong, proud and developed city. And then Russia came. Brought ideas of just such an inadequate level. And now it is a ghost town that has lost most people, thousands of lives and absolutely all prospects. Only the return of Ukraine, which will definitely happen, only our flag and only Ukrainian law will mean a normal life for these territories, for these cities - again. The life that was there. Peaceful, safe, open to the world. And of course - new matches of world-class teams at the Donbas Arena. I am grateful to President of Poland Andrzej Duda, a friend of all Ukrainians, for the fact that he has now started a special trip to European countries to support the European perspective of our country. This June we are to get a decision on the candidacy. And all our friends, all our diplomats are now working for this, working in full. President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová was to go with Andrzej - such a joint initiative of the two leaders was planned. A positive COVID-19 test hindered it. Well, these are the conditions of our life now. I wish Zuzana a speedy recovery. I spoke today with German Chancellor Scholz. About the decision in favor of Ukraine on the candidacy as well, which, in fact, will be a decision in favor of Europe. We talked about defense support. And about food security, guaranteeing which is really a global interest already. Because no one can be interested, except the Russian state, in the global food crisis. I addressed today the participants of the investment conference organized to discuss the economic prospects of our state. Representatives of the world's largest funds were among the participants. Although the event was not public, it was still very important and powerful. I invited them to invest in Ukraine. Invest. I also talked to members of the community of leaders of major American companies. This is the 133rd such summit, and this year it brought together the leading forces of global business. We discussed how business can help Ukraine withstand. I urged them to leave the Russian market and not to support this war with their taxes. It is very important for me to see that such an audience - and these, I emphasize again, are representatives of the most influential part of American business - believes that sanctions against Russia should be strengthened. Therefore, it would be right for politicians to hear this position. Leading business and the majority in American and European societies believe that there is still not enough pressure on the Russian Federation to end this war. According to the results of this day, the 105th day of the full-scale war, Severodonetsk remains the epicenter of the confrontation in Donbas. We defend our positions, inflict significant losses on the enemy. This is a very fierce battle, very difficult. Probably one of the most difficult throughout this war. I am grateful to everyone who defends this direction. In many ways, the fate of our Donbas is being decided there. I also signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 285 combatants were awarded state awards, 68 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to our heroes who defend the state! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen! Thank you for the invitation! Glad to be able to address you today. I know that business people will listen to me, not politicians, so I will be as specific as possible. So that both your time and my time are used to maximum advantage. Ukraine has been subjected to an unprovoked and extremely brutal full-scale attack on our land by the Russian Federation. This war has been going on for 105 days already. And we are waging this war in such a way that, I am sure, no one has any doubts about our victory anymore. It will definitely be achieved. And the more qualitative our cooperation is, the faster it will happen. I offer you to consider today two horizons of cooperation with Ukraine - short-term and long-term. Of course, you can join our success story. Join our victory. Just now. These are very simple, very transparent tools. The first tool is our United24 platform, a special fundraising platform with which we accumulate funds to restore life after hostilities. This is demining, this is the purchase of equipment for hospitals, humanitarian support. This is very important. Each contribution gives us the opportunity to see that Ukraine has one or another specific but true friend. Hence, we see who we will be grateful to. The second tool is Ukraine's military bonds. Even now, during a full-scale war, we are demonstrating absolutely conscientious service of our debt. So, military bonds are a tool for you to support us in the fight for freedom and to make money. Make money for you. But I still want to pay more attention to the long-term horizon today. To the reasons why it will be profitable for you to cooperate with Ukraine not just now, but now and for many more years to come. I offer you to see it in the long run as they say. What exactly are these opportunities? I will name five main ones: Europe, IT, agriculture, green energy, localization of production. Ukraine is access to the entire market of the European Union. Duty free access. We are working to ensure the same access to the G7 markets. And this is our own market, one of the largest in our region. Ukraine is qualified hard-working specialists, one of the best in Europe. Ukraine is a space of digitization that gives simplicity, gives, most importantly, transparency to any relationship between person and state, between company and state. This is something you will not find today in most countries of the world. Ukraine is an IT sector that enjoys one of the most favorable legislations in the world - a special legislative regime ""Diia City"". And I propose to move the headquarters of IT companies to Ukraine, to create joint service centers and R&D centers. Ukraine is resilient institutions even during a full-scale invasion. Our banking system, finances, government agencies remain absolutely stable, working in spite of everything. Ukraine is an agricultural sector whose global significance has already been seen by all when Russia blocked our ports. It is our agricultural sector that is key to the markets of dozens of countries. It is really profitable to develop processing in Ukraine. Ukraine is industrial parks that provide special opportunities for any manufacturing enterprise. Huge potential in various industries, from aerospace to woodworking. Ukraine is rich in natural resources, from natural gas to lithium ores. And Ukraine is green energy, green fertilizers and green hydrogen. All this together is a guarantee of Europe's future energy security when we replace Russia with its dirty fossil fuels. Ukraine is an ambitious program of post-war reconstruction, which will be the largest economic project in Europe of our time. All of these are priorities for me, so they can become priorities for you as well. Nowhere in the world will you find all these economic factors at once. They are only here, in Ukraine, and you can already join the work with them. And, of course, I understand that next to everything I say now, there is one word. And this is the word ""war"". The war continues. But we withstood a powerful blow. We defend our territory. And we are moving towards one of the greatest military successes in Europe. We will win this war. And working with you, it will happen faster. Political history always goes alongside economic one, and when success is possible, it can be common only - both at the state level and at the business level. We offer you just such a success. Because we feel that our defense in this war and our work for the victory have shown everyone in the world that we really deserve success. I invite you to cooperate! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Good health to you! A brief report on the past day. There were many activities - both diplomatic and domestic. First, the government is setting up a headquarters to prepare for the next heating season. This decision was made as a result of a meeting I held today with both government officials and representatives of our largest state-owned energy companies and regulators. Prime Minister, Ministers of Energy, Economy, Minister for Communities and Territories Development, heads of Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Energoatom and the National Commission for State Regulation of Energy and Utilities. The relevant Deputy Head of the Office of the President was also present. Whatever the occupiers plan for themselves, we must prepare for the next winter - in our state, on our land, for all citizens. The issues of purchasing a sufficient amount of gas for the heating season, coal accumulation, and electricity production were discussed today. In the current situation due to Russia's aggression, this will indeed be the most difficult winter of all the years of independence. But! Everything is alright. We must go through it so that our people feel the normal work of the state. At this time, we will not be selling our gas and coal abroad. All domestic production will be directed to the internal needs of our citizens. At the same time, we are doing everything we can to increase our electricity export capabilities. This will be made possible by the capacities available in Ukraine. And after the historical accession of our country to the unified energy network of Europe, such exports not only allow us to increase our foreign exchange earnings, but also directly influence the stabilization of the energy situation in neighboring countries, which reduce Russian energy consumption. Another important aspect is the repair program for thermal power plants, combined heat and power plants and boiler houses. In particular, for those who were damaged or completely destroyed by Russian strikes. Implementation of this program in the coming months is one of the top tasks for the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine. I would like to emphasize that I have set a very specific task for the government to do everything possible to ensure that gas and electricity tariffs do not change in the next heating season. People already face enough difficulties because of the war. This will be provided. Local authorities are responsible for tariffs for heat and hot water, and the same level of tariffs should be ensured at the local level in the winter of 2022-2023 as well. I also held a meeting on communication with the European Union and with individual EU member states on our application and candidate status. Diplomatic activity in this direction does not stop even for a day. I hear daily reports, including on the preparation of procedural decisions in the European Union. The team of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our diplomats, the team of the government in general - all, absolutely all are working to achieve a significant historical decision already in June, which we all expect. For its part, Ukraine has done all, absolutely all the necessary work for this. As they say in such cases: the ball is in the court of European structures, European countries. The frontline situation in Ukraine has not changed significantly over the past 24 hours. The absolutely heroic defense of Donbas continues. The hottest spots are the same. First of all, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna. It is felt, absolutely felt, that the occupiers did not believe that the resistance of our military would be so strong, and now they are trying to attract additional resources in the Donbas direction. Just as in the Kherson direction – new units are being transferred there to restrain our actions. But what's the point for them? The majority of the occupying contingent is already well aware that they have no prospects in Ukraine. We hear this mood in the appropriate interceptions of conversations. This is the prevailing mood in the Russian army. We are free people. We are not your slaves. More than 31,000 Russian servicemen have already died in Ukraine. Since February 24, Russia has been paying almost 300 lives a day for a completely pointless war against Ukraine. And still the day will come when the number of losses, even for Russia, will exceed the permissible limit. We are actively working to raise funds to support our army and to rebuild Ukraine after hostilities. In the territories that are already de-occupied, we return electricity, gas, water supply, communications. It’s not easy, but we do it. Of course, much remains to be done. It is necessary to provide hospitals with equipment, carry out demining. And, of course, rebuild everything destroyed by the occupiers. One of the tools for this is the state fundraising platform UNITED24. In the first month alone, more than one and a half billion hryvnias have been raised with its help. And I am grateful to everyone who contributed to its creation, to its work. Today, Elina Svitolina, our famous and very successful tennis player, became the ambassador of UNITED24. Together with Andriy Shevchenko, the first UNITED24 ambassador, Elina will work to attract new support for our country. Everything for Ukraine. This way, working together, each of us will be able to return normal life to all territories to which our military has returned security. And another piece of news that can be reported now. Next week, a special ""Book of Torturers"" is planned to be launched - an information system that collects confirmed data on war criminals and criminals from the Russian army. I have repeatedly stressed that they will all be held accountable. And we are approaching this step by step. The creation of such an information system has been going on for some time already. These are specific facts about specific people who are guilty of specific violent crimes against Ukrainians. And such a ""Book of Torturers"" is one of the foundations of the responsibility of not only the direct perpetrators of war crimes - soldiers of the occupying army, but also their commanders. Those who gave orders. Those who made possible everything they did in Ukraine. In Bucha, in Mariupol, in all our cities, in all the communities they have reached. Everyone will be brought to justice. Eternal memory to all whose lives were taken by these occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who is bringing our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Good health to you! Today was a busy day. A day of important communication, important meetings. I congratulated the journalists on their professional holiday. During the war, the word ""holiday"" sounds very unnatural, but every year on this day, June 6, greetings are heard for the people on whom, of course, we all depend. On the information they spread. On the speed at which they work. Of course, we do not celebrate this year. But still, we congratulate them. We still note the contribution of journalists of Ukraine and all those on whom the work of the media depends: cameramen, engineers, editors, photographers, producers and everyone without whom broadcast is impossible and websites will not work. These are the people who keep the information front and to whom I am grateful for this on behalf of all of us, all Ukrainians. Today I awarded correspondents and media workers who are working on the battlefield now. I also presented awards to the relatives of those whose lives were taken by the war. 32 media workers have been killed since February 24. This list includes different biographies, different personal stories. And not only citizens of Ukraine. Today, during a special ceremony in the President's Office, everyone was remembered. Their memory was honored with a moment of silence. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about our capabilities and key current dangers, especially in Donbas and in the southern regions of Ukraine. I am grateful to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for fully understanding our needs and for his willingness to provide Ukraine with the weapons we so desperately need to protect the lives of our people. I also spoke with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Of course, about defense support for Ukraine. This is a mandatory topic for each of my negotiations. And I am grateful to our partners who act quickly and do not postpone their decisions. I am grateful to Poland. The issue of candidate status for Ukraine was also discussed with Andrzej, which is a key political issue right now. We are waiting for the decision of the European Union on our application in the coming weeks. I believe that this will be a decision not only about Ukraine, but also about the entire European project. About whether it has a future as a really strong union. I am preparing for a new wave of appeals and communication with the political and expert communities of the world in order to guarantee our state the support we so desperately need. This is a constant process - the maintenance of attention, and it cannot be stopped for a single moment. And that applies to everyone, really. Every modern person is well aware of how the media works. It is very difficult to keep an eye on one topic for a long time. For the attention to Ukraine, to our struggle for freedom not to decrease, everyone must continue to talk about what is happening. Please share information. Support our needs. Of course, this primarily applies to journalists. And today, by the way, I want to wish them not to be locked on our internal Ukrainian context. The more we say about Ukraine in the world, the sooner we will be able to end the war and liberate our land. Of course, this applies to all representatives of the state and Ukrainian politics. Work for our defense - in unity and in full force. But do not forget that business, culture and ordinary people can also do a lot to keep Ukraine at the top of global attention. A simple example - today I was presented with postage stamps issued in Spain in support of Ukraine. It may seem that the postage stamp can’t change anything. But it is a symbol of the attention to our struggle that millions of people will see. Creating such symbols, encouraging the creation of such symbols, talking about Ukraine and encouraging talks about Ukraine - this is what will help us in negotiations with representatives of states on specific important assistance that Ukraine needs today. Our heroes hold their positions in Severodonetsk. Fierce street fights continue in the city. Lysychansk, Slovyansk, Bakhmut, Sviatohirya, Avdiivka, Kurakhove and other directions of Russian strikes are the hottest points of confrontation today. The Russian army is trying to use additional forces in the Donbas direction, but it is the 103rd day - and the Ukrainian Donbas stands. It stands firmly. We do everything for the defense in the Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv directions as well. I am grateful to everyone who endures the strong pressure of the occupiers and defends our state. 17,864 combatants have been awarded state awards of Ukraine since February 24. This number 100% demonstrates the scale of our people's heroism that became the response to Russia's full-scale invasion. I signed a new decree today on awarding our military. 121 warriors were awarded, 32 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our heroes!

Expressed support to our military and awarded the best. Heard the report. We were in positions. Had a meeting with the head of the regional state administration, the leadership of the local police, the Security Service, and some mayors of the temporarily occupied cities. Met with Mariupol residents, who managed to leave the city alive and with children. Here they were met by Khortytsia, humanely and warmly. Conditions - I saw - are temporary, but not bad. Understood their difficult questions. I think we will solve them. Each family has its own story. Most were without men. Someone's husband went to war, someone’s is in captivity, someone’s, unfortunately, died. A tragedy. No home, no loved one. But we must live for the children. True heroes – they are among us. After that, together with the Head of the Office we headed east. We were in Lysychansk, we were in Soledar. I am proud of everyone whom I met, whom I shook hands with, with whom I communicated, whom I supported. We brought something to the military. I will not talk about it in detail.

0,"Greetings from Kyiv! I will start this address with a short yet very important quote. ""If we live in some world, we hear some songs or radio, we watch some movies - this is all that creates us, creates our mentality."" These are the words of Mantas Kvedaravičius. He told them commenting on his film about Mariupol. A film with which he wanted to show how war affects the city. How war changes people. And these are seemingly simple words. But they are really about how it is determined what kind of life people have and what kind of people they are. Art itself, culture - in all its forms and in all their senses - shape people, educate them. Or vice versa - close them in the dark, in lies. And it can also be the responsibility of movies, books, songs and radio - everything we hear, see, read. That is why it is important to bear the truth. It is important to support art that is for life, not for those who want to destroy that life. Ukrainians will remember Mantas Kvedaravičius as a man who was just like that. He really deserves the Golden Swan. He valued life and always spoke out against what was life-threatening in his view - and that was a very attentive view. And I ask you to be just as attentive. So that you also support life. And remember Ukraine, Mariupol, and the fact that this war that took Mantas' life, Russia's war against Ukraine, must end. End as soon as possible. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine! Info. The Lithuanian National Film Award Sidabrinė gervė was held under the patronage of Prime Minister of the Republic of Lithuania Ingrida Šimonytė.

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! On this day, the 101st day of the full-scale war, the Skete of All Saints burned down in the Svyatohirsk Lavra in the Donetsk region. It caught fire as a result of Russian artillery shelling. Not the first shelling of the Lavra. Three Lavra monks were killed by the Russian shelling on Wednesday. Worship services are forced to be held in the basement. The roar of artillery and the ""arrivals"" of Russian shells are constant in the Lavra. And this is one of the three Lavras of Ukraine. This is the Lavra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is still considered in Moscow to be connected with the Russian Orthodox Church. Even this does not stop the Russian army. They are ready to burn everything: Orthodox churches just like anything else in Ukraine. During the full-scale war, 113 churches have already been destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. Among them are the ancient ones - those that withstood World War II, but did not withstand the Russian occupation. There are also those that were built after 1991. Reconstruction of the Skete of All Saints of the Svyatohirsk Lavra began in 2001. June 10 would be another anniversary of the beginning of construction. I was interested in what Russian propagandists would say about the destruction of the skete. But, in fact, nothing interesting. They are very predictable. Ukrainians are accused of arson. Although the monks and laity in Svyatohirya saw perfectly that it was Russian artillery. I believe that this lie of the propagandists, this shelling, and the support of the Orthodox hierarchs in Russia for the aggression against Ukraine - all this should motivate the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to draw conclusions. More decisive conclusions and a clear condemnation of each of those who condone aggression. Ukrainian diplomats will do everything to make everyone in the world aware of this another crime of the occupiers. Russia is deliberately and systematically destroying Ukraine's cultural and historical heritage, as well as social infrastructure, housing, and everything necessary for normal life. A state that does this cannot be a member of UNESCO and cannot remain at the UN as if nothing had happened. The UN Charter does not provide any rights for terrorists, and UNESCO is not a place for barbarians. Russian troops again fired at the border areas of the Sumy region, Mykolaiv, cities and communities of the Zaporizhzhia region, Kharkiv region. The situation in Severodonetsk, where street fighting continues, remains extremely difficult. It is also difficult in Lysychansk, Marinka, Kurakhove, other cities and communities of Donbas. Constant air strikes, artillery and missile fire. As of this morning, the total number of various Russian missiles used against Ukraine is already 2,503. Our heroes hold their positions and do everything to inflict maximum losses on the enemy. I am grateful to each of our defenders who are approaching the day when Russia will have to leave Donbas alone. Today in our country the memory of children who died from Russian aggression was honored. Over the past day, the worst figure - the number of children killed - has not changed. 261 children. That's how many Ukrainian children lost their lives because of Russia. But this is the official number. The more we learn about those who were buried in the occupied territories, the greater, unfortunately, may be the number of names on this list. It's scary to read. Year of birth, place of residence, circumstances of death... All of them would be alive now if only one person in Moscow had not caused this catastrophe. This can no longer be fixed. Because this war is already going on. But the terrible consequences of this war can be stopped at any moment. The Russian army can stop burning churches. The Russian army can stop destroying cities. The Russian army can stop killing children. If the same person in Moscow just gives such an order. And the fact that there is still no such order is an obvious humiliation for the whole world.

0,"Greetings, Washington! Today is the hundredth day of Russia's full-scale war against us, against Ukraine. I want to tell you a story so that you understand what this war means to us. I want to tell you about Svitlana Klymenko, a nurse at a hospital in the town of Ivankiv near our capital. On February 24, the first day of Russian invasion, Svitlana lost her husband. He worked as a paramedic and went out on a call in the area where Russian troops tried to advance on Kyiv. Since then, the first day of the war, he has been regarded as missing.  The war also took away Svitlana's other closest person, her son. He perished in Mariupol. Svitlana spent over a month under occupation until her town Ivankiv was liberated from Russian occupiers. Despite the pain of loss, she didn’t give up. She was doing her job. Just her job. Throughout the occupation, she worked at Ivankiv hospital and helped to save people. When I met her recently, she told me that it had been this work that had helped her make it through this. Saving others became her own life’s purpose. Svitlana continues working to this day. Like thousands of doctors and nurses, who have been rescuing people since February 24: children, women, and the elderly, because Russia does not spare anyone.  We must do everything we can to support them. So that they have something and somewhere to treat patients and where to treat them as well as armored ambulances, safe from Russian troops, who are shooting them. The Russian army is ruthless. They are not only trying to kill as many people as possible but also to destroy all the infrastructure required for living. Bridges and roads, houses and hospitals, schools and factories. Burned-out cities, universities, and maternity hospitals, destroyed by missiles.  Ruins are all that is left behind by the Russians. But people need to have somewhere to return. Right now. Today. That is the reason I initiated the special United24 platform. It is not just fundraising. It is also one of the ways to prove to Russia that evil will not win. Thousands of wounded need help. Thousands of objects need to be restored. Ladies and gentlemen, you can join in.  How – is entirely up to you. Rebuild the bridge to Irpin, whose photos have attracted worldwide attention, or buy medical equipment that will help Svitlana Klymenko and her colleagues save many, many lives. Your help will be transferred fast and used as effectively and transparently as possible. We guarantee that thanks to these donations your names will forever go down in the history of Ukraine, the history of defending freedom and democracy. Please join United24 today. Thank you, everyone! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Mayors of the United States of America! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today. The United States has become a true leader in Ukraine's international support. This is defense, financial and political support. And it is based on a sincere connection between all nations who equally value freedom. On the fact that we, Ukrainians and Americans, equally understand the dangers of tyranny. The world has seen various tyrannies. At different times. Under different flags. And all of them are united by the fact that they despise the rights and freedoms of ordinary people. Tyrants do not recognize the rights and freedoms of local government. And it is usually the free people in the cities which still choose freedom that put an end to the history of tyrants. And to put an end to this, tyrants must not be allowed to enjoy ties to the free world. Any ties. You know that dozens of American cities maintain the so-called ""brotherhood"" with the cities of the Russian Federation. Chicago and Moscow. Jacksonville and Murmansk. San Diego - Vladivostok. Albany and Tula. What do these connections give you? Probably nothing. But they give Russia the opportunity to say that it is not isolated, even after beginning such a war. Each of you sees how the Russian army wages war and what it is doing to the peaceful cities of Ukraine. Its cruelty is no different from the tyrannies of earlier times. Mariupol was a port city, an industrial center with half a million people. Russia simply destroyed it. There is nothing there but ruins. Just as the city of Volnovakha and dozens of other cities that the Russian army burns daily. Burns with bombs, missiles, artillery. Just imagine - since February 24, Russia has used almost 2,500 different missiles against Ukraine. The vast majority of them were aimed at cities. At city infrastructure. And some of the most deadly Russian missiles are designed and manufactured in Yekaterinburg. Which, by the way, is still a sister city of San Jose. I'm sure many of you have seen and heard what Russian soldiers did in our city of Bucha. Mass killings, torture of people. The bodies of the killed locals laid on the streets while Russian soldiers remained in the city. One of those Russian brigades that did all this against our people in Bucha was a brigade from the Khabarovsk Krai of Russia. And the capital of this region - the city of Khabarovsk is still a sister city of Portland. What for? I leave you this question. Now, in order to restore normal life in Bucha and in the Bucha community, almost 2,000 buildings need to be rebuilt. You understand better than anyone else what this means for any city, when 2,000 houses are destroyed or damaged by missiles and hostilities. These are ordinary houses, ordinary schools, sports facilities, medical institutions. In total, as of February 24, 3,620 settlements in Ukraine faced Russian occupation - both large cities and small towns. In each of them there is destruction. Many of them are simply not suitable for civilized life. This is the reality that Russia has brought. When there is no connection in cities, there is no electricity, there is simply no water. When bombs and missiles can destroy any building - even a kindergarten or university. When the whole city can just be burned. But I believe that Ukraine will be able to defend freedom, and tyranny will definitely lose. People will again be able to live peacefully and safely in Ukrainian cities. And to make it happen faster, we have planned an ambitious project to rebuild Ukraine after this war. I invite you - your cities, your companies, your business and professionals - to take part in this project. You can also become the people who choose to defend freedom and thus put an end to the history of tyranny. Thanks to the leadership of the United States and the support of all our partners, Ukraine's bravery receives the necessary weapons to fight for freedom. But the economic advantage of a free world must also be demonstrated. That is why we are already inviting our partners to join the reconstruction of Ukraine. Take patronage over a city, region, or industry that has been destroyed by Russian strikes. And rebuild them with the latest technology. This may be the largest economic project of our time, which will strengthen Ukraine, each country and each company that will participate in the post-war reconstruction. You can join the implementation of this great project. This will definitely mean economic growth, innovation and new social opportunities for both our country and your cities. Ladies and Gentlemen! The beginning of the annual Conference of Mayors of the United States this year coincided with the 100th day of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. There are many issues on your agenda that concern the internal life of your country, your cities and communities. But remember - the full-scale war in Europe and the destabilization of world markets, which occurred because of Russia, directly affect the lives of every nation and all cities of the free world. Therefore, call for even more pressure on Russia. Don't help it justify itself. Don't maintain ties with it. And please do not allow those who have become murderers to call you their brothers and sisters. Help Ukraine. Help even more. Participate in the reconstruction of our cities, our communities that are liberated from the occupiers. Thank you very much for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Great people of great Ukraine! Exactly one hundred days ago we all woke up in a different reality. Exactly one hundred days ago, different us woke up. When Ukrainians are awakened not by the sun's rays, but by the explosions of missiles that hit our homes, then completely different Ukrainians wake up. In 2014, Russia came to us with one word, with a new word. And this is the word ""war"". On February 24, Russia added another word to it, making the phrase ""full-scale war."" And during a hundred days we found or received, saw or wanted to erase other words. There are few of them. They are different. But they reflect what we have experienced. Among these words are some new to us. And those that were forgotten by our parents, but that we had to recall. Well known to everyone on the planet. And those that all people have to remember with horror. Painful words. And those that really give us hope. All of them are important. It will be right to recall them all today. One hundred days - one hundred words. First of all, these are two words: ""our heroes"". First of all, people who have been defending our state since the night of February 24. And then - the Ukrainian words: ""palianytsia"", ""Armed Forces"", ""Stugna"", ""Cossack"", ""Zmiinyi"" and... Of course, ""Chornobaivka"" is a word that has sounded many times already and in which you can see everything about our resistance and about our enemies. And also - foreign words that have become native to Ukraine: ""Bayraktar"", ""Harpoon"", ""HIMARS"", ""Starlink"", ""Rzeszów"" and... Of course, ""Lend-Lease"" - another word, just one, but it reflects 100 days of struggle, 100 days of diplomacy, 100 days of support. And a word that reflects something important in our character. In the Ukrainian character. The “Javelins” that frightened the enemies because they did not expect the armor wouldn’t save them. And then caused a smile, our smile, when Ukrainians also painted ""Saint Javelin"". Well, the word to which everyone in Ukraine raises a toast - ""Neptune"". Every day we had words that are much more than just words for everyone now. Hard words. “Hostomel”, “Borodyanka”, “Okhtyrka”, “Chernihiv”, “Kharkiv”, “Kherson”, “Izyum”, “Melitopol”, “Mariupol” and “Azovstal”. And with them - ""army"", ""artillery"", ""Marines"", ""border guards"", ""intelligence"", ""National Guards"", ""police"", ""territorial defense"", ""aviation"", ""our heroic pilots""... And also the word ""ghost"". The ghost of Kyiv. Who destroyed enemies and survived. We may not have heard all these words as many times in our lives as we have heard them in these hundred days. And every time we hear them, we know: they give us the time and opportunity to live as long as we are given. Given by God. Not by the enemy. ""God"" - this word, this appeal has been heard more than once. And always in a special way. There were also words that our enemy wanted to erase. ""Volnovakha"" and ""Saltivka"", ""Popasna"" and ""Severodonetsk"". These are words that we will definitely write again. But in our way. Just like ""Bucha"". Just like ""Mariupol"". And we will surely write them next to the word ""tribunal"". For other words - ""filtration"", ""deportation"", ""torture"", ""execution"", ""carpet bombing"", ""missile strike"" - to surely get an answer. Answer with just one word - ""justice"". Justice that will become a full stop after the temporary words for us ""occupation"", ""Mordor"", ""orcs"". Of course, they will leave our lexicon. We will definitely drive them out of our land. There were also words that gave hope and for which we fought particularly. ""Humanitarian corridors"", which have become a road of life for hundreds of thousands of people and made it possible to overcome another word, the terrible word ""blockade"". From the first day we have words the distance between which is as between darkness and light. We avoid one word. This word is “refugees”. And due to another word, we believe that millions of our people have a future. It will be at home, in Ukraine. This word is “displaced persons”. A lot has changed. When we hear the word ""Patron"", we remember the most famous sapper of Ukraine. And when we hear: “marathon”, we understand that it is not about sports at all. And of course, a lot of deadly words have been added to our lexicon. The words no Ukrainian ever wanted to see. And the words a normal person cannot be proud of. ""Iskander"", ""Kalibr"", ""Solntsepyok"", ""phosphorus bombs"" and more. For some reason we did not see their vaunted Armata tank. I think they were afraid of our new phrase: “tractor troops”. And one more phrase is worth mentioning: ""the second army of the world"". At first it looked threatening. Then it was dangerous. After Bucha - it caused disgust. And now - only a bitter smile. Because what's left of it? Of the army, which was called the second army in the world... War crimes, disgrace and hatred. And - numbers instead of words. When you see the number of killed every morning. The number of wounded. The number of shelling occasions. The number of missiles. When next to the word “children” there is a new number every morning. Today - 261. Already 261 children were killed by the Russian invasion. For what? There are no words that can answer this question. Words have appeared that are now very common. Which sound daily. But we must make sure that for our children they no longer mean what they mean to us today. So that they can perceive them only as history. First of all, it is the word ""ruins"". But also - siren, air alarm, curfew, checkpoint, barbed wire. And the word - mines. There will be many more words that everyone will know. Which will make sense for everyone. And which will give a chance to millions. These are the words - reconstruction, candidacy and membership, guarantees and security. And definitely the word ""return"". Of course, based on the word that was a dream, but will become a reality - ""liberation"". These are the words of our future! These are the words about what we will do to our red viburnum, to our glorious Ukraine. The words about where the enemy warship is heading and will always head. About what to do with the occupiers when someone says: ""Vova!"". And of course - our folklore already - ""Good evening! We are from Ukraine!"". From Ukraine, where the field is blooming, but her hair is getting gray. From Ukraine that stands and will stand. Ukraine, whose glory and freedom have not yet perished. Ukraine, to which we say - glory! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the nation! And everyone knows the next phrase: ""Death to the enemies!"" Because there are three words we have been fighting for for a hundred days already after eight years: peace, victory, Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! We have three important pieces of news. First, the European Union is gradually moving towards the implementation of the sixth sanctions package. Frankly, achieving this is very difficult. Because this sanctions package is primarily about oil. Finally, the world is giving up Russian oil. Moreover, other countries, which produce much better and lighter oil, are preparing to replace Russian supplies. Therefore, huge revenues are lost for the aggressor state in this sphere. Of course, Russia is constantly trying to counter this. It has long enjoyed the flow of petrodollars and does not want to be weaned off it. But it has to. It has to get used to the fact that a very painful reduction in income is an inevitable consequence of the war for its culprit, for the Russian state. The second piece of news is that the United States has confirmed at various levels that modern HIMARS are being sent to our country. These weapons will really help save the lives of our people and protect our land. I am grateful to President Biden, all our American friends, and the people of the United States for their support. We are looking forward to it. We also expect good news about the supply of weapons from other partners. For example, today we have a new package of defense aid from Sweden. I am very grateful to the leadership of this state. We are working to bring the supply of modern combat systems to a much higher level. Third, more and more embassies resume their full-fledged activities in Kyiv. As of today, there are already 50 of them. This is very important not only in practice - for the work of diplomats, but also on a symbolic level. Every new embassy that returns to our capital is a testament to the faith in our victory. Faith that Ukraine will be able to defend its statehood in this war unleashed on our land by the Russian Federation. A new and, I think, very important and beautiful tradition was launched today. From now on, the ceremony of presenting credentials by ambassadors of foreign countries who start their mission in Ukraine will take place not just in Kyiv, but on the territory of our St. Sophia Cathedral. And the first ambassadors that presented credentials today in such a new ceremony were the ambassadors of Moldova, India and the United States. Why there? Why in Sophia? Because it is the sacred, historical and statehood center of our people. Receiving the credentials of the ambassadors there, we demonstrate who the Ukrainians are, what we are and what is behind us. We hereby express our highest respect to the representatives of other nations. We open up to them. And at the same time we show that we expect from them the same respect, the same sincerity to the Ukrainian people, to our interests and to our history. Immediately after the ceremony, I spoke with the new ambassadors. Impressions are good. I hope for productive work. Today there were two important addresses: to the Luxembourg Parliament and to the participants of the Security Forum in Bratislava, which was attended by President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and other friends and partners of our country. Of course, the key task is still to accumulate maximum support for Ukraine. First of all defensive, financial and, of course, political. Almost every address leads to increased assistance to our state. It is very important that now - in a few weeks - we are waiting for the answer of the European Union on the issue of candidate status for Ukraine. We are very much looking forward to it. And I am grateful to all those who have already spoken in support of our state, in support of the candidacy. In particular, in response to my requests in appeals to the parliaments of different countries, forums, student and expert communities, people in the squares of various European cities who rallied in support of Ukraine, in support of our people. We must understand that Russia has now mobilized all its forces to thwart Ukraine's European movement. And every tool - especially public debates and appeals - must be fully used. The situation in Donbas has not changed significantly in a day. We had some success in the battles in Severodonetsk. But it's too early to tell. The situation there is the hardest now. Just as in the cities and communities nearby - Lysychansk, Bakhmut and others. Many cities are facing a powerful Russian attack. The Russian army uses all its armed capabilities and does not count people at all. It is especially cynical that in the first line of the offensive the occupiers very often use those people who were recruited into their army in the previously occupied territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russian soldiers often simply hide behind these so-called mobilized. The longer the war lasts, the more vile, shameful and cynical things Russia inscribes in its history forever. Absolutely senseless shelling of our border northern regions, in particular Chernihiv, continues from the Russian territory. Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, the Kharkiv region were shelled. The entire temporarily occupied territory of our state is now a zone of total catastrophe, for which Russia is fully responsible. We have already started working on new sanctions packages against Russia. Step by step, we will deprive the Russian state of all the elements of the modern economy. The occupiers will pay the full price for destroying the lives of neighbors. And no lobby in any country will help Russia. Today I signed a new decree on awarding our defenders, our heroes. 223 combatants were awarded state awards, 72 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to each of our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Good afternoon! Thank you very much for this opportunity! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear friends! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. This year, for the first time in its history, the Bratislava Forum is organized in such a way that its panels will be held not only on land, but also on water. On a ship on the Danube. And it seems to me that this image is important. Because today discussing the challenges to European security and stability, the threats to all humanity in a comprehensive way is simply impossible without taking into account everything that is happening on water. One of the most important targets for the Russian army in Ukraine today is bridges across rivers. There are occasions when the Russian army strikes missiles three times at the same bridge to completely destroy it. It is impossible to overestimate the threat that Russian aggression has created for the water potential of our entire part of Europe - the center and east, the Black Sea basin. The nature of the fighting of the Russian army is frankly barbaric. They just destroy absolutely everything. Both residential buildings and industrial enterprises are being brutally bombed. In particular, environmentally hazardous chemical plants, metallurgical plants, etc. Fighting in Donbas has created a threat of groundwater pollution since 2014. If the flooding of coal mines in Donbas continues - among them, for example, the Yunkom mine, where an underground nuclear explosion took place in 1979 - poison and even radioactive contamination can get not only into the rivers of Ukraine, but also into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Of course, speaking about the security challenges associated with our waters - the waters of rivers, the waters of the seas, it is impossible to avoid the blockade of Ukrainian ports by the Russian Federation. Because of this act of aggression by the Russian state, the world is on the brink of a food crisis. And it's not just a food problem. This is a shortage in the market. This is a catastrophic rise in prices for basic products. This is a threat of hunger for tens of millions of people in different countries. If this is not prevented, we will get the problem of political chaos in some countries in Africa and Asia. Consequently, the migrant crisis in Europe, when people from countries suffering from hunger will seek salvation. Also, the food crisis will inevitably lead to large-scale protests in European countries. Many governments will have to explain to protesters on the streets of various European cities why our continent has been taken hostage by one state - Russia - and one person - in Moscow - who ordered the naval blockade of Ukraine. And now I have mentioned only a few consequences and only in one area of many in which we have extreme threats. Extraordinary challenges. How should we respond to all this? Ladies and Gentlemen! Let's remember the Danube River again. It equally enriches different nations and different cities. Bratislava, Vienna, Budapest, Linz, Regensburg, Belgrade, Izmail and others. Slovakia, Austria, Germany, Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Moldova and Ukraine. For the Danube to remain clean and safe, for its economic potential, including transport, to work in full, the cooperation of all countries to which nature has given this river is needed. Therefore, unity is needed. Mutual understanding is needed. We need the ability to speak and negotiate for the common good. And these, by the way, are the key things for a peaceful and free life in Europe. This is what Slovakia can do. This is what Ukraine can do. This is what other partner states can do. And this is what Russia deliberately ignores. Does it try to hear someone? Understand? No. Does Russia recognize common interests? No. It sees only its own, and treats them quite specifically. Not as the interests of the entire Russian people, but as the selfish desires of a handful of state owners. And how does Russia perceive the very concept of unity? Only as an attempt to subdue others, to make them dependent on it, to destroy their identity. This is how they interpret unity - when the other and any diversity is simply destroyed. And this is exactly what they are doing on the territory of Ukraine. They are trying not just to kill people, but to erase the very fact that there is our state, that there is Ukraine. And that Ukraine seeks to be a full-fledged part of a united Europe. This is an openly anti-European policy of Russia. And such a policy obliges Europe to react, to react in a principled manner. First, to support Ukraine even more actively. With weapons, finances, politically. We are grateful for the help we already receive. To everyone who helps us. But arms supplies need to be increased. Because it is on the battlefield in Ukraine that it is decided whether freedom in Europe will be preserved for all nations without exception. And right now on the battlefield in Ukraine is a situation that could provide a turning point in the confrontation. Right now, these days, when Russia will lose the war against Ukraine, the freedom of Europeans will win for decades to come. Secondly, these are sanctions. The main purpose of the European Union's sanctions packages is not just to harm Russia, but to make Europe independent of Russia, to sever all critical ties between Russia and European countries that Moscow uses as a weapon, including the energy one. That is why I consider it unacceptable when so much time is spent discussing the sanctions package, in particular the sixth one. These are all our people, these are all our days. More than a month! Of course, it is good that the sixth sanctions package has finally been agreed. But it must start working immediately so that it is possible to move on to the preparation of the seventh sanctions package. Every remaining link between Europe and Russia is a rope that the Russian state will try to turn into a stranglehold. Thirdly, we must strengthen the unity of Europe, true unity. And the main step in this direction should be to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union, and subsequently full membership. There can be no temptation in Russia to assume that European countries will not support Ukraine in this matter. Because if Russia feels that Europe is weak and can leave Ukraine without the obviously necessary decision on candidacy, it will be one of the biggest destabilizing factors for the continent during Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! We must respond to all the challenges and dangers that the Russian Federation has created against us. Politics, economics, military sphere, food, environment, migration - there is no area of our lives in which there is no catastrophe, crisis or threat of catastrophe or crisis due to Russia's actions. The quality of our answers directly depends on only one thing - our unity. Any division in Europe is a chance, a chance for Russia. For it to continue its aggressive policy. I believe you are aware of this. So, I believe that we will be able to protect our continent and our people from everything that threatens us today. But we also have to think about tomorrow. About what will happen after the victory, together with you, we believe in our common victory over tyranny. That is why Ukraine is already working on a large-scale United 24 initiative. It is a system of tools that can, when fully built, protect not only our state, but also other nations from the threat of armed aggression, natural disasters and anything that can destroy lives. We aim to make sure that every state that needs help can receive it in 24 hours. Unfortunately, there is no such tool in the world today. Although it is obvious that there is a need for it. So, I urge you to familiarize yourself with how the first element of this future infrastructure works. Fundraising platform that allows you to accumulate funds from different sources for different needs, including defense, infrastructure, medical, social. Anyone without any bureaucracy can decide for themselves how to help a state in need. Gradually, we will add other tools to United 24. Diplomatic instruments, sanctions, technical tools - together with you. They will significantly upgrade the existing global security architecture. I am sure that the need to update it will also be one of the key topics of your discussions. So, pay attention to the Ukrainian proposals. And do not forget that the state, for which anything is a weapon or a way to aggression, is trying to destroy us all. Including your peaceful and beautiful Danube. Defend us! Defend yourself! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, members of the government, everyone present! Dear people of Luxembourg! Thank you for the opportunity to contact you. Your state has a wise and extremely relevant motto: ""We want to stay what we are."" And this is now perceived in a special way. You cannot pass by these words. Because what are we fighting for? For what we are. And to stay what we are. Free, independent, open and united with all Europeans. We have been fighting for this right, this aspiration for a very long time. Much longer than Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine. By the way, tomorrow is the hundredth day of this war. And when this characteristic is used - full-scale - it is usually just a rhetorical separation of the ongoing war from the war that Russia started in 2014. Then, 8 years ago, the Russian army invaded our land and occupied part of it for the first time. The Crimean peninsula and a third of Donbas, including the largest cities, Donetsk and Luhansk. The fighting in Donbas lasted for 8 years. There were very hot and bloody phases of confrontation. There were also short periods of ceasefire, which cost many great diplomatic efforts. Ukraine has lost more than 14,000 people killed - from 2014 to February 24 this year. More than one and a half million people have become internally displaced persons. As a result of the then campaign of invasion, the Russian army controlled more than 43,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory. This area is comparable, for example, to the area of the Netherlands. And for most European countries, such a scale of war would be enormous already. But on February 24, Russia showed that it was not a scale at all for it. It showed that its cruelty is much greater. Russian troops entered 3,620 settlements in Ukraine. 1,017 of them have already been liberated. Another 2,603 are to be released. As of today, about 20 percent of our territory is under the control of the occupiers. Almost 125 thousand square kilometers. This is much larger than the area of all the Benelux Countries combined. About 300 thousand square kilometers are bestrewn with mines and unexploded ordnance. Almost 12 million Ukrainians have become internally displaced persons. More than 5 million, mostly women and children, have gone abroad. Fighting continues on the huge territory from the city of Kharkiv in the east of our country to the city of Mykolaiv in the south. A straight line between them is 454 kilometers long. But if you look at the entire frontline, and it is, of course, not straight, this line is more than a thousand kilometers. Just imagine! Constant fighting, which stretched along the frontline for more than a thousand kilometers. Every day Ukraine suffers from Russian missile strikes. Just yesterday, Russia used 15 different cruise missiles. And since February 24, 2,478 missiles have been used. Most of them were aimed at civil infrastructure. We have to defend ourselves against virtually the entire Russian army. All combat-ready Russian military units are involved in this aggression. The occupiers’ death toll is already more than 30,000 soldiers. That's greater than the death toll of the Soviet Union in 10 years of war in Afghanistan. Greater than Russia’s death toll in two Chechen wars. But this does not stop Russia. This state is still ready to lose and kill, kill people. Because only one person in Russia doesn’t want to let us stay what we are. The Russian army has already destroyed almost the entire Donbas. This once one of the most powerful industrial centers in Europe is simply devastated. The occupiers are destroying it city after city. Just look at the city of Mariupol. There were half a million people, ordinary peaceful life in an important industrial city. Now there are burnt out ruins. And we still don't even know exactly how many of our people were killed by the occupiers. At least tens of thousands - tens of thousands in a little less than 100 days. This is what it means, in fact, to characterize this war as full-scale. And that is why we are so loud urging the world to support us. First of all, calling for defense support. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine has shown extraordinary bravery. We did not surrender to Russia. We have stopped and are gradually pushing the army of invaders, which was recently considered the second strongest in the world, out of our territory. Nobody expected Ukrainians to have courage of this magnitude. But this magnitude is there. And this quality of our character, our willingness to fight for freedom and for our values - and these are the common values of all free Europeans - is now based on the support we have received from our partners. I am very grateful to you, the authorities and the people of Luxembourg, for the historic decision to provide Ukraine with weapons. Unlike other states, Luxembourg does not have large military depots or significant defense industry. But you have shown solidarity on the scale of a great nation and provided defense assistance in a timely manner - how important it is - and without excessive bureaucracy, as befits people with a great soul. You have proven that your potential is stronger than that of some who have remained weak even despite a much larger geographical scale. I am also grateful to you for participating in the sanctions pressure on Russia. Only together can all democracies ensure that Russia is satisfied with the scale of its own territory and never encroaches on the lives of other countries. We understand that no one will be able to stay away and avoid being affected when a catastrophe of such enormity occurs in the world because of the Russian state. It is reminiscent of World War II, when Nazi aggression threatened the lives of entire nations. Therefore, we must significantly increase the pressure on Russia to stop this catastrophe and prevent such aggressions in the future. We need more weapons for Ukraine - modern weapons that will ensure the superiority of our state over Russia in this war not only through courage, intelligence, but also technologically. And I ask you to advocate this need before other European states. More sanctions on Russia are needed for the war. As soon as the sixth sanction package is imposed, we should all prepare the seventh. All Russian officials working for the war and all Russian judges working for repression must be subject to the sanctions. The assets of these and other persons, both individuals and legal entities, subject to sanctions, as well as the assets of the Russian state in foreign jurisdictions must be frozen. All of them. And we need to find a legal way to confiscate them in order to compensate for the damage that Russia has done to the victims of the war. That will be fair. And - instructive for the aggressor. We must show that European unity outweighs any doubt about Europe's ability to defend its values. Ukraine has de facto become part of the European Union. We are already cooperating both bilaterally and at the EU level on a scale commensurate with full membership. What can prove this better than the fact that we protect each other? And I believe that your country - as one of the founders of a united Europe - will support first the candidacy for Ukraine, and later the membership in the European Union. I am sure that your specialists and companies will join the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. And this will be the largest economic project in Europe of our generation. Luxembourg's investment and technological potential and ability to organize a comfortable city life are well known. And I believe that we will see how your potential will work in Ukraine for the benefit of both our nations. I invite you to visit our capital, Kyiv, so that we can discuss our further cooperation in detail. We will be glad to hear your speech in our parliament - in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! I want to recall these words again: ""We want to stay what we are."" Right now, Russia's war against Ukraine is crucial for the whole of Europe as well. This is a war for values. When we win this war, all Europeans will be able to continue to enjoy their freedom. But if the person who wants to destroy any freedom in Ukraine and Europe prevails, there will be a dark time for everyone on the continent. One that has already been in the history of Europe, which has brought the continent a lot of suffering and victims. And an echo of which can still be heard sometimes today, unfortunately, in the voices of those who are trying to undermine European unity. Tyranny must lose. So that Europe can stay what it is. What it is now. Free, open, united and able to be strong in diversity. And I am grateful to you for the fact that the Grand Duchy is truly defending freedom with us. Thank you all! Thank you Luxembourg! Glory to Ukraine!

0," Ukrainians! Defenders! Every year on June 1 we celebrate Children's Day. A special day when adults pay special attention to the rights of children, safety and development of our kids. But since February 24, everything has changed in our country. And literally every day now is a day of protection for us. Protection of all our people, children, our future. Protection of a free country where every child can, when he or she grows up, live the life he or she wants. Without coercion and oppression. Everyone sees what Russia brings to Ukraine and what it wants to bring to other European countries. Total contempt for individuals, for entire nations. The Russian state despises even its own citizens so much that they do not understand the value of human life at all. Russian soldiers kill and die themselves as if they were not people, but just dust. Dust under the feet of the owners of Russia. The principles of our life are completely different. And although life has changed with the onset of wartime, our principles remain the same. Every person matters. This is the main thing that distinguishes us from the occupiers. During the 98 days of the Russian invasion, 689 children were injured as a result of the occupiers' attacks. And these are only those we know about. We do not yet have all the information from the territory that is currently occupied. But from what is known today - 446 children were injured, 243 children died. 139 went missing. It is said that human consciousness does not perceive large numbers. The larger the number, the harder it is for a person to realize what is behind it. Destroyed families. Little personalities who did not even have time to see what life is like. Like little Denys from the Zhytomyr region, from the village of Malynivka, who died with his whole family when a Russian plane dropped bombs on the village. Denys was less than two years old. Like Stepan from the village of Novi Petrivtsi, Kyiv region. He was less than three years old when a Russian shell hit the yard. The kid was fatally wounded. Like Anya from Bucha, Kyiv region, she was 14 years old. She was killed when the Russian military fired at a minibus on the road. People were just trying to escape. Anya was in that car with her mother and grandmother. They all died. Polina, she was not even two years old. A Russian tank fired at a house in Borodyanka. An ordinary house. Direct hit. Polina died. Arina, Mykolaiv region. On March 5, she received shrapnel wounds as a result of artillery shelling, the occupiers hit the usual residential sector. She died at the hospital. Now, in June, Arina could be 4 years old. Svyatoslav from Odesa, he was 15 years old. He was killed by a Russian missile strike at a dormitory. It happened on May 2. His body was retrieved from the rubble of the house. Alisa from Okhtyrka, Sumy region. 7-year-old kid. She died on the second day of a full-scale war as a result of Russian artillery shelling. The occupiers simply fired at the houses. Mykyta from the city of Izyum, Kharkiv region. He was 3 years old. On the night of March 3, he was killed by a Russian air strike at the city. A total of nine people died that night. Two sisters - Varvara and Polina from Mariupol. Varvara was 14 years old and Polina was 11. They died as a result of the Russian shelling of an apartment building. I have named only ten children from the list of two hundred and forty-three. And it's not just numbers. Each line is a separate world that was destroyed by the Russian army. In this list there are those about whom nothing is known at all, even the name... 243 children! Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken away by the Russian war against us, against Ukrainians, against Ukraine. About 12 million of our citizens have been forced to flee their homes due to the war. More than 5 million went abroad. And the vast majority of them are women with children. We will do everything so that they can return home to Ukraine. Russia is also pursuing a consistent criminal policy of deporting our people. Forcibly deports both adults and children. This is one of Russia's most heinous war crimes. In total, more than 200,000 Ukrainian children have been deported so far. These are orphans from orphanages. Children with parents. Children separated from their families. The Russian state disperses these people on its territory, settles our citizens, in particular, in remote regions. The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people, but to make deportees forget about Ukraine and not be able to return. But we must find a solution to this challenge as well. And ensure that all those who killed, tortured or deported Ukrainians are held accountable. The inevitability of punishment is a principle that Ukraine will definitely teach Russia. But first of all, we must teach it on the battlefield that Ukraine will not be conquered, that our people will not surrender, and our children will not become the property of the occupiers. Today I signed two new decrees on awarding our heroes. 380 combatants were awarded. In total, since the beginning of the full-scale war, 17 thousand 86 defenders of Ukraine have received orders and other awards. Thanks to all those who defend our state, our people, our children, we can be sure that Ukraine has everything, and has a future. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Finally, we have the specifics about the European Union's sixth sanctions package on Russia for this war. The package was agreed. Its approval and entry into force will take some time. But the key elements of the package are already clear, and most importantly - its direction. European countries have agreed to significantly limit oil imports from Russia. And I am grateful to everyone who worked to reach this agreement. The practical result is minus tens of billions of euros, which Russia will now be unable to use to finance terror. But it is also important to understand that European countries' abandonment of Russian oil and other fossil fuels will accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources. Strategically, this leaves the Russian state on the sidelines of the modern economy. With such an aggressive policy and a course of isolation from the civilized world, Russia simply will not be able to adapt. So, it will lose. Lose economically. We are also looking forward to the disconnection of one of the largest Russian banks - Sberbank - from SWIFT within the sixth sanctions package. Finally, there is the cessation of broadcasting of Russian disinformation channels in Europe. And new personal sanctions. We will also work on new restrictions against Russia for this war. As soon as the sixth package starts working, we will start preparing the seventh. After all, there must be no significant economic relations of the free word with the terrorist state. I discussed further sanctions policy of the European Union with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová. I am grateful to her, a true friend of Ukraine, for today's visit to Kyiv, for substantive negotiations and for an inspiring speech in the Verkhovna Rada. From the first days of the full-scale war, Slovakia has become one of our most important defense partners. And we will continue this cooperation. We are also preparing solutions for more effective management of processes at the borders of our states. In particular, joint customs control. At the beginning of her visit to Ukraine, the President of Slovakia visited Irpin and Borodyanka and saw with her own eyes the destruction caused by the Russian army. Anyone who sees this for themselves no longer needs to be persuaded why Russia must bear maximum responsibility for this war. I believe that Slovakia will provide all the necessary assistance to bring to justice all Russian war criminals and to rebuild everything they destroyed after the war. Today I would also like to address those in Ukraine who are trying, so to speak, to ""hurry up"" the Armed Forces of our state or to indicate how to attack and where to repel enemies in the first place. Ukraine values every opinion. But Ukraine values every life first and foremost. And this is an axiom. And Ukraine will never do like Russia, which throws people into hell of battles just because Moscow wanted to seize something in a few days or by a certain date. Our military, intelligence, the National Guard and all those involved in the defense of the state are gradually but inevitably thwarting all the plans of the occupiers. The frontline situation must be assessed comprehensively. Not by one area, where there is the most tough situation and which attracts the most attention, but by the whole frontline. The situation in the Donbas direction is very difficult. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Kurakhove are now at the epicenter of the confrontation. Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Severodonetsk, the Russian army's strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just madness. But on the 97th day of such a war, it is no longer surprising that for the Russian military, for Russian commanders, for Russian soldiers, any madness is absolutely acceptable. We have certain success in the Kherson direction, as well as an advancement in the Kharkiv region. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are rebuffing the pressure of the occupiers in the Zaporizhzhia region, the key direction is Hulyaipole and Orikhiv. In this broad picture, it must be seen that our defenders are showing the utmost courage and remain masters of the frontline situation, despite the fact that the Russian army still has a significant advantage in equipment and numbers. Of course, everyone in Ukraine wants all our territories, all our people to be liberated today, as soon as possible. The full restoration of the territorial integrity of our state is our goal. But we must act carefully, valuing life. Everyone at all levels must now be lobbyists for the supply of modern heavy weapons and modern artillery to our state. All those systems that can really speed up the victory of Ukraine. Talk about it wherever it is useful and wherever it is heard. Speak to the politicians of the partner countries, to the representatives of foreign media, even to your friends abroad. This narrative of the need to provide Ukraine with enough weapons to win must be maintained constantly. I work for this every day. I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 215 combatants were awarded state awards, 17 of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who are fighting for our independence! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today, one of the key tasks of the day was communication for the approval of the sixth package of sanctions by the European Union. The pause in agreeing on new sanctions in Europe has been too long. The fifth sanctions package was introduced on April 8. So, a lot of time has passed without strengthening European sanctions against Russia. I emphasized that this should finally be corrected - and corrected immediately - in my address to the leaders of European countries who gathered for a meeting of the European Council. In particular, to discuss this issue. I am grateful to Charles Michel, President of the European Council, for supporting the interests of Ukraine, the interests of the whole of Europe and for trying to find the necessary compromises as soon as possible so that the European Union's sixth sanctions package can be adopted. Russia must feel a much higher price for its aggression. The key point is, of course, the oil. I believe that Europe will have to give up Russian oil and oil products in any case. Because this is about the independence of Europeans themselves from Russian energy weapons. And the sooner this happens, the more complete the abandonment of Russian oil will be, the greater the benefit will be for Europe itself in the end. I also spoke today about strengthening sanctions with the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France. Catherine Colonna paid a visit to Kyiv. In addition to sanctions, we also discussed the issues of defense support for Ukraine, our European integration and the need to act much faster to prevent the escalation of the food crisis in the world. Now, due to the fact that Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and seized our part of the coast of the Sea of Azov, we cannot export 22 million tons of grain that are already in warehouses in our country. This is the volume that was to enter the foreign market. And Russia's blockade of our exports is destabilizing the situation on a global scale. As a result, food is becoming increasingly expensive in different countries. Consequently, there is a threat of famine. In Africa, in Asia, in some European countries. This threat could escalate into a new migrant crisis. And this is what the Russian leadership clearly wants. They are deliberately creating this problem. So that the whole of Europe faces difficulties. And so that Ukraine does not receive billions of dollars for its exports. These are the billions that our economy really needs now. And the inhabitants of African and Asian countries are used by the Russian state simply as a bargaining chip. Against this background, the stories of Russian officials at various levels that some sanctions allegedly do not allow them to increase exports of their food look particularly cynical. As if they allegedly want to prevent a crisis, but sanctions allegedly hinder them. It is clear that they are lying, as always. First, Russian food was not blocked by sanctions. And secondly, in our occupied territory, the Russian invaders have already stolen at least half a million tons of grain and are now looking for ways to illegally sell it somewhere. To sell it in a way to make money on what was stolen and to keep the deficit in the legal market. I spoke today with Turkish President Erdoğan, in particular, about this threat to food security. About how to ensure normal traffic from Ukrainian Black Sea ports. And, of course, about how to speed up the end of this war - Russia's war against our state. We also discussed further defense cooperation between Ukraine and Turkey. Today in the Luhansk region, the occupiers disrupted the evacuation from the areas of hostilities by firing at a car following the locals. French journalist Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff was killed by the shelling. He worked for the French TV channel BFM TV. A little over a month ago, I gave an interview to this particular TV channel. This was my first interview with the French media during a full-scale war. My sincere condolences to Frédéric's colleagues and family. He became the 32nd media representative killed after February 24. The situation in Donbas remains extremely difficult. The Russian army is trying to gather overwhelming forces in certain areas to put more and more pressure on our defenders. There, in Donbas, the maximum combat power of the Russian army is now gathered. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Kurakhove, Slovyansk and some other settlements remain key targets for the occupiers in this direction. And I am grateful to all our defenders who, despite the technical and sometimes quantitative advantage of the occupiers, heroically hold the defense. Today, Russian troops shelled Kharkiv again. The territory of our Sumy region was also shelled across the border between Ukraine and Russia. The struggle for the Kherson region continues. Step by step, we are liberating our land and gradually approaching the point where Russia will have to lay down its arms, count all its dead and move to diplomacy. Definitely have to. Eternal glory to everyone who defends the independence of Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who died at the hands of the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear friends! I am glad to be able to address all of you without exception. Today is the 96th day of Russia's full-scale war against our state, against all of us and against all of you. Against European unity. Russia wants to see at such meetings not a united European Council that we see now, not a united European Union, but 27 separate states, 27 fragments that cannot be put together. This is their wish. This policy of the aggressor is consistent, and there is no delay in it. Unlike Europe, Russia does not need to hold such summits and seek compromises for weeks. By the way, I want to thank you for talking about these compromises, for striving to find help and support for Ukraine. So, they are not ready to compromise, choosing what to do to achieve their goals. And now we see how the Russian offensive in Donbas is destroying our cities, destroying the communities of Ukraine, and at the same time how the European unity, the desired European unity may falter. On April 8, the 44th day of the war, the EU's fifth sanctions package was imposed. And 52 days have passed since then. What happened during this period? At that time, as of April 8, there were 169 children on the list of those killed by the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. As of today 243 children are on the list. At that time, as of April 8, 928 educational institutions were destroyed. Kindergartens, schools, universities. As of today – 1888. According to the information for the past day, the number of Russian missile strikes at Ukraine is already almost 1,600. Russia has used more than 2,400, almost 2,500 different missiles against us, against the civilian population. And then, as of April 8, there were less than a thousand strikes and they used about a thousand missiles. This is the progress of their aggression. And, of course, I want you to understand me - I'm not blaming any of you. It is only the Russian state that is to blame for everything that is happening. But I am convinced that it is obvious to each and every one of you that there should be progress in sanctions for this aggression. And for us it is crucial. And it will help us a lot! The progress that makes Russia begin to seek peace. And only this can be our common demand. Peace. There can be no compromises at the expense of our territorial integrity, our sovereignty! I am grateful to everyone who promotes the sixth sanctions package and tries to make it effective. However, unfortunately, for some reason it is not there yet. And why do you depend on Russia, on their pressure, not vice versa? Russia must depend on you. Why can Russia still earn almost a billion euros a day by selling energy resources? Why are banks of a terrorist state still working with Europe and the global financial system? Serious questions. And why are Russian propaganda channels still active in the European Union? This is an information weapon of the Russian Federation. Why are Russian civil servants who support the war and judges who openly support repression still not under sanctions? Each of these important questions is not just about sanctions packages or the war in Ukraine. All this is about us. All this is about Europe itself. Dear friends! Ladies and Gentlemen! Only through greater unity can we find effective responses to everything that Russia is doing against us and against you. If someone torpedoes a ship, one or more cabins cannot hope to stay afloat when others drown. You can see that the consequences of Russia's aggression have gone beyond our continent. And they will definitely return with even bigger problems for the whole of Europe. For example, large-scale famine in Africa and Asia will mean a threat of a new large-scale migrant crisis for southern and south-eastern Europe. And when you hear food blackmail from Moscow, please know that this is their deliberate strike at your societies. To ensure this strike, Russia simply uses the people of Africa and Asia as hostages, deliberately pushing them to starvation. So that people from there flee to you en masse. Are you ready for this? I don’t think so. Let's take a look at price instability in the energy market. It's not just some of the usual market fluctuations periodically observed. Last year, Russia created conditions for the record increase in gas prices. Now, investing in instability, Russia is making all energy prices skyrocket. For what? For Europeans to protest, not against the aggressor and their aggression, but against their own states. Against you personally. Against their leadership. And if this is a threat to each and every one of you, if this is Russia's bet on political chaos in your countries, why do some people still think they can defend themselves alone? Europe must show strength. Because Russia perceives only strength as an argument. It's time. It’s time for you to be not separate, not fragments, but one whole. Ukraine has shown by its own example why this is important. Why it's important to be united. In our country, starting from February 24 there is the maximum unity, everyone is working for one result - state protection. And thanks to this we managed to do what the world did not expect, Russia did not expect - Ukraine stopped their army, and everyone was afraid of it, everyone remembers. And we managed to liberate part of our occupied territory. Greater unity is truly the foundation of this strength. You know this. Finally, all quarrels in Europe must end, internal discord that only encourages Russia to put more and more pressure on you, on the whole of Europe. The sixth sanctions package must be agreed upon. It must be effective - including oil. So that Russia feels the price of what it is doing against Ukraine and against the whole of Europe. And for you and us to finally become independent from Russian energy weapons. At least from its oil part. And we must immediately find a solution that will prevent the food crisis from unfolding. Of course, I thank you for your efforts together with partners to create green corridors for agricultural exports from Ukraine. But still, you understand that a reliable guarantee of food security is impossible without ending Russia's war against Ukraine on our land. Because there can be no peaceful trade, no steady agricultural production, if Russia retains the ability to intercept ships with Ukrainian agricultural products. And not only in the Black Sea. Or to strike at our cities, ports, elevators, other infrastructure. And if this was felt even at such level, why is Russia still not recognized as a terrorist state, a state - sponsor of terrorism? And another aspect. The European home was never complete without Ukraine. It won’t be. There will never be a full-fledged European power without Ukraine. The very fact that Ukraine remained a fragment of Europe, somewhere outside your countries, contributed to the fact that Russia has developed an aggressive appetite to seize its neighbors. Only the enlargement and strengthening of European unity can prevent the recurrence of what Europe experienced on February 24, in 2014, and even in 1968 or 1956. Therefore - at the strategic level - the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union for Ukraine should be approved already in June. I would like to express gratitude to the countries of the Western Balkans for their understanding and support for granting candidate status to our country. Thank you very much. On April 8, when the fifth sanctions package was approved, we also received a questionnaire from the European Union. And we have already answered it over this time. We have already provided these answers to the European Commission. Unprecedentedly fast, and most importantly - in a coordinated manner. We expect the same reaction from Europe. And we reject any attempt to find an alternative that no one needs, or to find something else for Ukraine. We need to be like you. We want Ukraine to receive candidate status. We have met all the necessary criteria for this status. And I am sure that those individual states that are still hesitant about us, you know it well, will change their minds and show our united strength. The strength of our nations who support our membership in the European Union by an unprecedented majority. The strength of your nations, the strength of your states and a united Europe. I want to thank you for your unity, ability to be united, energetic, to have a future in a strong European Union and to ensure that the developments in the world depend on us. So that we depend on ourselves, not on some offices somewhere in Moscow. Right now you can determine whether everything that the European Union says about itself is true. About unity in diversity, common values and the same approach to all European democracies. We need a common customs space that will strengthen both Ukraine and all those involved in trade with us. We need a common payment space that will accelerate integration at the level of ordinary people. And a common roaming space. It is very important for our displaced people, more than 5 million of them, not to experience discrimination. And, of course, further armed and financial support for Ukraine is absolutely necessary. Now our common freedom depends on our success on the battlefield, and your stability depends on our stability. And this is another reason to find and freeze, and then confiscate all Russian assets and allocate them for the reconstruction and compensation for the damage caused by the war. Dear colleagues! Dear friends! We have already started a conversation with most of you about rebuilding Ukraine. We are creating a large-scale recovery plan. The global United24 support project has been activated. The European Commission is also preparing a platform for reconstruction. I urge all of you to join these initiatives now. If rebuilding begins during the war and becomes truly pan-European, it will be one of the most convincing pieces of evidence for everyone and, of course, for Russia in particular, that Europeans are strong. And they will not allow any of the integral parts of Europe to be destroyed. Neither Ukraine nor any other part. And finally. A 9-year-old girl died today as a result of the Russian shelling of the Kherson region of Ukraine. Two more children were wounded: a 7-month-old baby and a 5-year-old girl. A normal person can’t just put up with it. With such crimes. Daily crimes. These are the deliberate killings by the Russian military of our civilians, our children. They know exactly who they are firing at. And I really count on your principledness and activity to bring to justice every Russian soldier who killed or tortured our people, and every commander who gave or condoned such orders. Europe can definitely do that. Let's do it! Because this is not just a question of the aggressor's responsibility for a particular war, but of protecting humanity as such. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!

Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers. Black, burnt-out, half-ruined apartment buildings face east and north with their windows - from where Russian artillery was firing. From where Russian combat aircraft arrived. They face Russia. And in them now, like in a mirror, the Russian state can see itself. See how much it lost during these 95 days of full-scale war against Ukraine. Russia has already lost not only the battle for Kharkiv, not only the battle for Kyiv and the north of our country. It lost its own future and any cultural ties to the free world. They all burned down. In particular, there, in Saltivka. I held a meeting with the leadership of the region and the city. Thanked them for being and remaining together with the people of Kharkiv, together with Ukraine. And - what is very important now - together with each other. They have one hundred percent cooperation - the army, the police, the mayor of Kharkiv, the regional state administration - everyone really works for victory and does it very effectively. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about the local leadership of the Security Service of Ukraine. I arrived. Clarified the situation. Dismissed the head of the Security Service of the region. For not working to defend the city from the first days of a full-scale war, but thinking only of himself personally. What were the motives? Law enforcement officers will find out. One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation. We will definitely liberate the entire territory. And everyone should work for this result in positions both at the local level and at the state level. Before the trip, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 222 combatants were awarded state awards. And during the trip today I had the honor to personally present some of the awards from this decree and others that were signed earlier. The post-war reconstruction of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region was discussed very objectively with the local authorities. We must use only advanced ideas, only modern technologies in reconstruction. In particular, security technologies. And the best offers from our partners. Kharkiv and all other cities and communities in our country affected by the war must be reconstructed to have the most modern look in Europe. Returning from the east to Kyiv at this time leaves a rather ambiguous impression. After Saltivka's silence, there is Khreshchatyk, full of people and smiles. After the roar of artillery on the frontline - the relaxation of Kyiv residents who today walked the city. On the City Day, the Day of Kyiv, which is celebrated by thousands of people every year. But it is for such happiness to live, live your normal life and just quietly walk the streets of your own city that this war is going on now. That's what we are fighting for in it. For everyone in Ukraine. Freedom and peace is what could really be felt in Kyiv today. Even in spite of the air-raid siren that sounded today as well. So, I wish you, the people of Kyiv, to keep this peace - the peace of life. Take care of your city. And be sure to remember what it cost to defend the capital. Remember how many lives were given for the capital. I understand that in your eyes - it's summer already. I understand all this. But I want you to have an understanding - we still have to fight. The war is not over yet. Sophia and Lavra, Andriivskyi, Podil, Volodymyrska, Reytarska, Lypky and Khreshchatyk... I am grateful to everyone who made sure that the occupiers would never have a place here in Kyiv again. And I am very much looking forward to the day when I will be able to say similar words to another of our cities. A city that should celebrate its Day today in the same way as Kyiv. But... Russia came too close to it. It gathered too many forces in our Donbas. It was too prepared for the offensive there. I consider it very symbolic that the Russian military began the attempt to capture Severodonetsk by entering a hotel called “Myr” (Peace - ed.). Peace is indeed Russia's first target. Having taken away our peace in 2014, the occupiers want to take away everything else. Literally everything. They want to leave us neither freedom, nor houses, nor life. As a result of the Russian strikes at Severodonetsk, the entire critical infrastructure of the city has already been destroyed. 90% of houses are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city's housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no mobile connection. Constant shelling. Capturing Severodonetsk is a fundamental task for the occupying contingent. And they don't care how many lives they will have to pay for this attempt to raise the Russian flag on 32 Druzhby Narodiv boulevard (Friendship of Nations - ed.) - no matter how bitter the name sounds now - where the Severodonetsk administration is located. We are doing everything to repel this offensive. There was not a day that we did not try to find more weapons, more modern weapons to defend our land, to defend our people. And I am grateful to everyone who defends Severodonetsk and demonstrates to the occupiers that peace will still be ours. In all our state, in all Donbas and of course - in Severodonetsk. And another city I want to address today. For me, of course, the city is special. My native Kryvyi (Kryvyi Rih - ed.) also celebrates its birthday today. Already 247th. It would celebrate. But the time is not appropriate. The conditions are not appropriate. And the enemy is still on our land. The time to celebrate will be after our victory. And it will come. And today I want to wish just that - to my hometown and to all cities and communities of our great country. A shorter time to victory. We must all work for this - each and every one without exception. In my inaugural speech three years ago, I said that each of us is a president. And right now it is felt the most. Because our future depends not only on my actions in this office, the office of the President of Ukraine, or on what is being done in other offices in Kyiv. But also on what is being done in Kharkiv, Sumy, Kryvyi Rih and Odesa, Lviv and Uzhhorod, Lutsk and Vinnytsia, Mykolaiv and Dnipro, Zhytomyr and Chernihiv, Poltava and Kropyvnytskyi, Chernivtsi, Frankivsk, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy. Of course, in Kherson, in the Zaporizhzhia region, and in all territories of our Donbas and Crimea. The unity I saw with my own eyes today in Kharkiv. The heroism our soldiers in Donbas show every day. The determination of Kryvyi Rih. This is our path. The path to ensure that the peace of life is always felt throughout Ukraine and that smiles always reign, not the roar of artillery. Eternal glory to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 94th day of the full-scale war is over. The situation is very complicated. Especially in those areas in Donbas and the Kharkiv region, where the Russian army is trying to squeeze at least some result for themselves. The key areas of struggle at the front are still Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Popasna and other cities where the Russian offensive is concentrated. But our defense holds on. It's indescribably difficult there. And I am grateful to all those who withstand this onslaught of the occupiers. We work every day to strengthen our defense. This is primarily a supply of weapons. Every day we are bringing closer the time when our army will surpass the occupiers technologically and by firepower.  Of course, a lot depends on the partners. On their readiness to provide Ukraine with everything necessary to defend freedom. And I expect good news on this already next week. Today, the Russian army has launched absolutely senseless, openly barbaric strikes at the Sumy region. Missiles, mortars. And for what? And what does it give? Ukrainians of the Sumy region, as well as any other region of our state, have already understood everything about Russia. And it will not be able to add anything by the new terror. And even more so, it will not be able to intimidate. As a result of the Russian shelling of Mykolaiv today one person died, seven were wounded, two - in a grave condition. The shells hit a residential area, twenty meters from the kindergarten. These are the enemies chosen by the Russian Federation. Again and again I will remind the world that Russia must finally be officially recognized as a terrorist state, a state - sponsor of terrorism. This is simply true. This is fair and reflects the daily reality that the occupiers have created in Ukraine and are eager to bring further to Europe. And this must be legally enshrined. I am preparing for the meeting of the European Council, which will take place on May 30-31. I will address the participants of the meeting. In particular, I will talk about it. About terror, which has become in fact the only form of action of the Russian state in relation to Europe. Terror on the land of Ukraine. Terror in the energy market of Europe, not just our country. Terror in the food market, on a global scale. And what terror will be next? Only together - all Europeans - will we be able to stop such a policy of such a state. Of course, in my address to the European Council I will pay due attention to the progress in the development of our state, which has already been achieved and which can be achieved in the near future. I will also continue to address the parliaments of European countries next week. There will be many other international activities aimed at strengthening our state and increasing the joint pressure of the whole free world on Russia. I spoke today with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On defensive support and fuel supply to Ukraine. On how we can unblock Ukrainian ports, and therefore prevent the food crisis from unfolding. Security guarantees for Ukraine were also discussed separately, and we need to intensify work on them. There is more and more information that the occupiers are trying to limit the departure of our people from the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region. They do not provide any humanitarian corridors. And they have closed the individual departure of people. Those who are confident in their position would definitely not make such decisions. This is clearly a sign of weakness. Manifestation that they have nothing to give people. And people do not want to take anything from them. So they try to take people hostage. But Ukraine will return everything that belongs to it. Everything. Definitely. And it's only a matter of time. And every day this time, the time of liberation, is reduced. We do everything for this. Eternal gratitude and glory to all who defend our state! Eternal memory to everyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Unbreakable people of our bravest country! All our defenders! Today I want to begin this address with words of gratitude to all emergency care workers. Today is their professional holiday. These are people who are really indomitable, really brave, really committed to a good cause. It is impossible to even count how many lives were saved by emergency care workers. No matter what the conditions are, no matter what the time is, they always do their job. I am grateful to everyone for a really quick help and really dedicated work. Grateful for the work during the pandemic. I am grateful that now, during a full-scale war, people have access to the ""ambulance"" in areas of hostilities. I am grateful for the real heroism, which is shown everywhere - by both paramedics and drivers. Unfortunately, this war also took the lives of those who did everything to save others. Eternal memory to them! Today, the representatives of our state - the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health - presented awards to emergency care workers. And this is the minimum that the state can do to honor what they are doing. But there will definitely be a maximum. Before this war, until February 24, we did everything to raise the salaries of the emergency care employees to a decent level. And we will definitely continue this policy when we achieve peace for our country. I held a meeting with the Cabinet of Ministers today. Heard the reports on a wide range of issues. I expect greater activity from government officials. In particular, to overcome the shortage of fuel caused by Russian strikes at the refinery in Kremenchuk and oil depots in different regions of the country. And to provide jobs for our people. And on other important economic issues. I continue to gather the broadest possible international support for our struggle. Today I addressed the political and expert communities of Indonesia. We talked about the threats that Russia has created for every country in the world now. The food crisis alone means a lot. Due to the Russian blockade of our ports, there is a shortage of food in the market. Consequently, price increases are being provoked. Consequently, political chaos is being provoked in those countries that are most dependent on our exports. I am grateful to the Indonesians for understanding the arguments of our country and for their support in countering crises Russia is provoking. I talked to Stanford University students today. It is one of the world's leading universities. It was nice to see Ukrainian students studying there. It was also gratifying to hear how sincerely and fully the American student community is aware that we in Ukraine are fighting for our common freedom - one for all in the world. I invited Stanford students to join the implementation of the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after graduation. Because this will really be the biggest project of protecting freedom for their generation. I spoke today with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on how to prevent further development of the food crisis. And on the supply of fuel to Ukraine - this topic is a must in all my contacts with European partners. And on the defensive support for our state. Of course, the situation on the battlefield was discussed in detail. Difficult situation in Donbas. As expected, the situation is very difficult. The occupiers are trying to achieve in at least a hundred days of war the goals they hoped to achieve in the first days after February 24. Therefore, they concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves in Donbas. There are missile strikes and aircraft attacks - everything. We are protecting our land in the way that our current defense resources allow. We are doing everything to increase them. And we will increase them. If the occupiers think that Lyman or Severodonetsk will be theirs, they are wrong. Donbas will be Ukrainian. Because this is us, this is our essence. And even if Russia brings destruction and suffering everywhere there, we will still rebuild every city and every community. And there is and will be no alternative to our Ukrainian flags there. As always, I signed a decree today to award our military. 198 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 4 of them posthumously. As well as 27 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Eternal glory to all who fight for our independence! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends! It is truly an honor to address your community for a second time - the Stanford University community - students, lecturers, all American men and women who care about Ukraine and empathize with our struggle for freedom. I am grateful to you for your interest and for such a number of sincere and caring bright eyes that I see now, see today. I see people in front of me, people who are not in bulletproof vests, who are not in helmets and who are not in bomb shelters. There are no wounded by enemy shelling among you. I am very glad. Glad for you. And this meeting of ours cannot be interrupted by an air alarm signal, because California is not threatened by Russian missiles. But, unfortunately, this is not the case in Ukraine. A lot has changed since last September, when I first visited Stanford during a visit to the United States. But on the other hand - much remains the same. As I said then, Ukraine is a country where anything is possible. And so it was. But now the whole world knows that even what others have been afraid to think about for many years is possible in Ukraine. Ukraine is a country that has destroyed the myth of the extraordinary power of the Russian army. An army that allegedly could conquer anyone it wants in a few days. But Ukraine is a country where the Russian army continues to wage a war it does not want to end. Now Russia is trying to occupy the whole country. But we feel strong enough to think about the future of Ukraine, which is and will be open to the world. Between September last year and May this year, our society has endured so much that I would not wish on any other nation. And we still have a new path to go from May this year to, say, the new September. I know that this path will be very difficult. Very painful. It will be a path on which young people won’t look at university professors or their friends from a peaceful life, as you do. But at their comrades in the trenches. And at the enemies who can be seen in sight or on video from reconnaissance drones. But I also know that for Ukraine on this path there will definitely be a stage where peace will begin. Now I use words that each and every one of you read and hear very often in the media, in books. ""Struggle for freedom"", ""myth"", ""Russian army"", ""war"", ""survived"", ""trenches"", ""path"", ""peace"". Each of these words seems to be immediately clear. But do you feel all their depth now? Yesterday, Russian troops again shelled the largest city in the east of our country - Kharkiv. Using MLRS and special artillery called ""Pion"". This is heavy artillery - long range and powerful. It was with these weapons that the Russian army fired at ordinary residential areas of Kharkiv yesterday. Just houses. There was no military object there. As a result of this and other shellings, 9 people were killed in Kharkiv yesterday. Peaceful inhabitants. A family with a small child, 5 months old, was also shelled. The father died. The child died. The mother is badly wounded. We have been receiving such or similar messages for 93 days since February 24 and for 8 years since 2014. That's how it is in Ukraine. Everyone who studies at Stanford is equally familiar with the question: what matters most to you and why? To study at your university, you need to write an essay in response to this question. And I'm sure a lot of brilliant essays have been written over the years at Stanford. And I am sure that in the last 8 years there have been many brilliant students at your university. Apparently, among them were those who survived the war. And their answers to this question - what matters most to you and why - probably differed significantly from the answers of those who were lucky enough to live in peace. And now I'm not talking about the quality of the text. I'm talking about the depth of the sense of words by a particular person. After the start of the full-scale war, we are holding a special award ceremony in Ukraine for our defenders. Those who excelled the most. And who was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. As a special tribute, I present the Order of the Golden Star to the Heroes of Ukraine in the hall of the presidential residence where the highest officials of foreign countries visiting Ukraine - presidents and heads of government - were usually met. Or I give the Order to the Hero's relatives, if this title is awarded posthumously. One of our pilots was recently awarded. Combat aviation pilot. One of the best. He died in the battles for Ukraine. When I gave his Golden Star to his wife, I expressed my condolences. Condolences that he passed away. And tears appeared in her eyes. She replied that he had not passed away. That he had been in the sky for 30 years. And now he remained in the sky. And tears appeared in my eyes. I felt that death did not conquer these people, this family. He remained in the sky. He is alive to her. And it will always be so in this family. And all these words: ""sky"", ""life"", ""death"", ""Hero"" - for him, for her, for me, for you - they are different. With their depth. Although these words sound the same to us. And this depth, this distance in the feelings, in fact, weighs a lot today. It explains, for example, why even on the 93rd day of the war we are forced to talk about increasing sanctions on Russia, which will be enough for this country to finally start looking for peace, at least thinking about it. It explains why it is sometimes so long and difficult for us to negotiate with our partners about the supply of exactly the weapons needed to liberate our land. Although they want to help. So for me, this question, on which you had to write an essay, feels different, a little different. Because, in fact, I have been answering this question for a very long time, more than 93 days, when I try to give my country everything it needs so that we can survive, defend our freedom and, in the end, win. What matters most to me and why? I do not know whether the current presidents of a state fighting for its freedom have ever answered this question. But here is my answer. Pragmatic. Weapons that will help overcome the technical and quantitative superiority of the Russian army. Sanctions that will stop the flow of money for Russian terror. Finances that will allow Ukraine to maintain social normalcy while the war continues. Blockade and confiscation of all Russian assets in foreign jurisdictions that should be used to rebuild everything that this Russian army has destroyed. A fair tribunal against all war criminals who killed, tortured, raped and deported our citizens. Updated efficient security architecture that will prevent such new wars in the world. And, of course, a complete restoration of normal peaceful life in our country. So that our people, our students, like you now, can communicate freely and in complete safety with the presidents of democratic states. So that Ukrainians, like you now, won’t need to think where the bomb shelter is. And so that they will not need to know what the air alarm sounds like at all. And I am grateful to all our friends in the world who make these words - and their depth - sound the same for everyone on whom decisions to help Ukraine depend. Many Ukrainians have recently learned about one of our boys. A child from Mariupol, a city that was completely destroyed by Russian shelling. This little boy in the evacuation was very grateful to all those who sheltered his family and other residents of Mariupol. He really wanted to thank those who helped. He invited everyone to pay a visit to him. He said - come to us next summer, to Mariupol. And he says: yes, there is no more city... but the sea is left! And this story is about life. Which is sure to win. And which matters most, in fact, for each and every one. And this story is about a man who remains sincere and grateful even in the most terrible circumstances, because he is a free man. And I believe that Ukrainians, having survived this war, will remain just that. Sincere, grateful and free. And I'm sure that after this war, something will change in the relationship between you - the American people - and us. It is already changing. We became much closer in our feelings. We know for sure that we mean the same thing when we say the word ""freedom."" When I returned to Ukraine last September, I was very encouraged. I thought about how much we could do together. But now I feel a similar uplift. Because I see your eyes and I believe that many of you will be in Ukraine and will help our reconstruction after the war, because this is the biggest project on the protection of freedom, in which your generation can take part. Our cities are destroyed. Our sea is still blocked. But we remain free. And finally. On February 24, a full-scale war against Ukraine began, when 18-year-old Russian guys, military men, entered our country and entered the homes of our people. To kill, torture, rape. It is difficult to understand - for what? Difficult. And exactly three months later, on May 24, on the other side of the globe, in Texas, an 18-year-old guy entered a regular school to kill 19 children and 2 adults. It is impossible to understand at all. This is a tragedy. And we live in a terrible time when Americans express condolences to Ukrainians over the deaths in war. And Ukrainians express condolences to Americans over the deaths in peace. Please accept my condolences. Every day you should not just ask yourself another question, but be sure to find the answer: who matters most and why? This is the main question for me: who matters most and why? Take care of yourself, your family, loved ones, friends. Take care of the world. Thank you, America! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you for the opportunity to contact you today and for the upcoming communication. I hope that this conversation will bring us closer to understanding how to prevent large-scale crises from unfolding in many parts of the world. And the world is now really on the verge of several crises. My country, Ukraine, is one of the largest and absolutely conscientious food exporters. Every year we export tens of millions of tons of grain and other agricultural products. Our producers provide a high place for Ukraine in the world's top exports of wheat, corn and vegetable oil. But for the fourth month in a row, Ukrainian exports have been blocked due to a full-scale war waged by Russia against our state on our territory. Russia has blocked access to our ports in the Black Sea and occupied our part of the Sea of Azov. As a result of this military blockade, most traditional Ukrainian trade routes have been closed. Currently, 22 million tons of grain in Ukraine are in storage facilities. We cannot direct them to the world market, where they are needed right now, at this time. It is already felt that prices for grain, and later for other food, could rise catastrophically. And the governments of food-exporting countries have to adopt decisions to suspend the export of certain agricultural products from their countries to somehow keep domestic prices from explosive growth and protect their own consumption. According to the UN, this year the world's hunger will affect an additional 40-50 million people. I consider such an assessment conservative. Hunger does not come alone. It is always accompanied by political chaos, which further aggravates the situation, destroys social life and creates even more dangerous conditions for ordinary people. Already in July - when last year's stockpiles will run out in many countries - it will become clear that the catastrophe is really approaching. Just look at the prices in stores now - their growth is a harbinger of what will surely affect people if nothing changes, if we can't change anything. It is a harbinger of poverty for the poor and impoverishment for the middle class. Just imagine the political chaos this could end with in certain regions. And I have cited only one aspect of how the war waged by Russia affects the whole world. And there are many such aspects, in addition to the threat of hunger and chaos. The very fact of Russia's naval blockade of Ukraine is no less destabilizing for coexistence in the world. This is not just an act of aggression by one state against another. This blockade of our ports is a kind of training for other potential aggressors who want to conquer neighbors or take away their territory. If Russia manages to go unpunished with this in the war against Ukraine, other states will see that the naval blockade is a supposedly permissible instrument of pressure in the modern world. Consequently, none of the trade routes at sea and no country will be safe after that. Let’s take the third aspect - the nature of the war waged by the Russian state against us. Since February 24 this year, the Russian army has used 2,400 different missiles against Ukraine. The vast majority was aimed at civilian infrastructure. The enterprises, warehouses, in particular warehouses with food, apartment houses, railway infrastructure. By the way, this is also important in terms of food security. We want to prevent the food crisis from unfolding. We are working to shift our exports to new routes - as much as possible in wartime - and to supply grain to the world market by rail through European ports. Of course, this may be a smaller volume of exports than through the Black Sea. But Russia is also trying to thwart our efforts by destroying railway bridges, railway stations and logistics centers with missiles. Dozens of Ukrainian cities and hundreds of villages were destroyed by shelling by Russian aircraft and artillery. It's just ruins. Black, scorched, empty cities. In three months, Russian warplanes have appeared in our skies more than 3,000 times. And there are no objects that they would try not to bomb. More than 600 healthcare facilities were destroyed - hospitals, maternity hospitals, clinics and outpatient clinics. Almost two thousand educational facilities - universities, schools, and kindergartens. Dozens of religious sites - churches, mosques, and other meeting places of religious communities - were burned or damaged by Russian shelling in various regions of Ukraine. Only yesterday and only in one of our cities, in Kharkiv, 9 people died as a result of Russian artillery strikes. Among them - a 5-month-old child and her father. The explosion threw the child from her father's arms onto the roof of the house. She was not even found at first. The mother was seriously wounded. The Russian military fired at ordinary residential neighborhoods. And this is the daily reality of our country since February 24. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine began much earlier. Back in 2014, Russia captured our Crimean peninsula and started a war in Donbas - in two regions of our country. This war remained local for 8 years, until Moscow decided to go on the offensive against our entire state. What is the meaning of this war for Russia? They talk about it openly. The Russian leadership believes that Ukraine should be a colony of Russia. And the Ukrainians? If the nation does not want to submit, it is decided to destroy it. The occupiers are also deporting our people to Russia and settling them in various remote regions. The number of such deported Ukrainians is hundreds of thousands. And this is also one of the ways to conquer the people. In fact, it is shocking how frankly Russia is trying to bring back to world life the order of the old days, when colonizers and empires imposed their policies or their domination on other nations. The fourth aspect is the attitude of the Russian occupiers towards the people in the occupied territories. We have the experience of Crimea, which since 2014 has been under control of Russia as an occupier. And it has become one of the most dangerous places in Europe. For all those who value freedom, for the indigenous people of Crimea - the Crimean Tatars, and for Muslims on the peninsula. There is not a single week - I emphasize this: not a single week in 8 years - that there is no news of repressions or trials against those whom the occupiers are not satisfied with. As a result, you will not find a place in Europe other than the Russian-occupied Crimea, where Muslims and all others who simply want to live their free lives are being repressed with such impunity and massiveness. How can this be ignored? This is happening in front of the eyes of the whole world! And the fifth aspect is that there has long been no such risk of using weapons of mass destruction. Russian state propagandists are openly threatening nuclear weapons. World politicians are preparing for the possibility of Russia's use of so-called tactical nuclear weapons or chemical weapons, biological weapons. What does this mean for the world? First of all, it can lead to a change in the attitude of different states to weapons of mass destruction. If Russia indulges in nuclear blackmail with impunity, it may seem logical to various forces in the world to acquire nuclear weapons for themselves. To say that it is dangerous for the whole world is to say nothing. Ukraine has made the greatest contribution to nuclear disarmament by relinquishing its third largest nuclear arsenal. This happened in the 1990s. Now Russia, contrary to its documented commitment to guarantee Ukraine's security after our state's renunciation of its nuclear status, is waging a war of aggression and colonization against us. And at the same time threatens with nuclear weapons. Who can believe in the idea of nuclear disarmament after that? And how to reliably guarantee long-term security to those regions that choose non-nuclear status after that? Six months ago, it was impossible to imagine that such questions would arise. But now it is also one of the consequences of Russia's aggressive policy. Ladies and Gentlemen! I have given you only 5 aspects of how Russia's war against Ukraine affects the global situation. I'm sure you realize that there are many more such aspects. This is the largest war in Europe since World War II. And today no one can predict one hundred percent what negative aspects for the world will definitely not be caused by this war. The sooner this war can be ended, the better it will be for each nation. Not just for us. The sooner our ports are unblocked, the sooner the food crisis will stop, because we will be able to send our stocks and new crops to the world market. Which this year, by the way, will still be less, as Russian troops deliberately mined fields and destroyed agricultural machinery. I believe that Russia has deliberately made a bet on the food crisis. To increase the dependence of other countries on themselves and to make access to food another factor of pressure in global politics. The sooner our lands are liberated from the occupiers, the more secure, in fact, will be the protection of people all over the world. Protection from the aggressive desires of those who want to pursue colonial policies, as in the old days. If the world is truly united and honest about this Russian aggression against our sovereign state, the speed of ending this war will be measured in weeks. Weeks, not even months. I am grateful to the leader of your country, the President of Indonesia, for inviting me to the G20 summit in the autumn. I accepted this invitation. And I believe that by the summit in the autumn, the world will have solved all these big problems. We must prevent large-scale famine. We must stop mass killings and repression. We must permanently wean any countries in the world from nuclear blackmail and playing with the threat of chemical or biological weapons. And I believe that at this Summit there will be only friendly states, partner states, and there will be no occupiers. I ask all Indonesians to pray for peace in Ukraine, for the people of Ukraine and for the wisdom of the world to be enough to save humanity from existing threats. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Exactly eight years ago, on May 26, the Donetsk airport stopped working. There is still a message about this: ""Attention! From 7 am, Donetsk Airport will temporarily suspend flights. The resumption of the airport’s functioning will be announced additionally."" On that day, apparently, no one foresaw how events in Donbas would develop over these years. And then - throughout Ukraine after a full-scale invasion. No one predicted for how long the word ""temporarily"" would be delayed in this announcement. But that day and any day later, and today, two things can be said with confidence. First. Ukraine will always be an independent state and will not be broken. The only question is what price our people will have to pay for their freedom, and Russia - for this senseless war against us. And second. The catastrophic developments could have been stopped if the world had treated the situation in Ukraine as its own. If the strong of the world had not played with Russia, but really pressed to end the war. Just look at the situation now. Look at the number of weeks the European Union has been trying to agree on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. So far, it receives almost a billion euros a day from Europeans for energy supplies. Of course, I am grateful to our friends who are promoting new sanctions. But where did those who block the sixth package get so much power? Why are they still allowed to have so much power, including in intra-European procedures? Look at the number of weeks the world has not dared to block the Russian banking system - all banks without exception, to deprive the aggressor of the opportunity to finance not only the war against us, but also the policy of creating splits and crises around the world. Look at how long we have been struggling to provide Ukraine with all the weapons it needs to change the nature of hostilities and start moving faster and more confidently to the expulsion of the occupiers. All weapons, including MLRS. The systems that are really needed to stop this aggression. We are confident that thanks to our efforts we will still be heard. Starting from May 26, 2014, and even more so from February 24 this year until today, there have been many opportunities for those who really have the strength to do so to put an end to it and say: now Russia will really feel the full price for what it is doing against Ukraine, against European unity and against freedom as such. The current offensive of the occupiers in Donbas can make the region uninhabited. They want to burn Popasna, Bakhmut, Lyman, Lysychansk and Severodonetsk to ashes. Like Volnovakha, like Mariupol. In cities and communities closer to the Russian border, in Donetsk and Luhansk, they gather everyone they can to fill the place of those killed and wounded in the occupation contingent. All this, including the deportation of our people and the mass killings of civilians, is an obvious policy of genocide pursued by Russia. Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians. A child (five months) and a father were killed. The mother is in grave condition. Among the wounded in Kharkiv is also a nine-year-old girl. Missile strikes again in the Sumy region, in Donbas again. Significant intensification of the occupiers' artillery in the Zaporizhzhia region again. Again, their efforts to burrow into the ground in the south. Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives. And every day of delay, weakness, various disputes or proposals to ""appease"" the aggressor at the expense of the victim is new killed Ukrainians. And new threats to everyone on our continent. I addressed the Latvian parliament and people today. Expressed gratitude for the help Ukraine received, including the defensive one. And for the help which the Latvian state and the Latvian people provide now. If everyone in the world had the same determination to defend our common freedom as Latvia and other partners who do not hesitate, there would simply be no evil that the Russian state has done to Ukraine, Europe and the world. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about the intensification of the occupiers' activities. We discussed how we can adequately enhance Ukraine's ability to defend itself and repel these attacks. I signed a new decree on awarding our heroes. 180 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 28 of them posthumously. The total number of awarded servicemen as of today is over 16,000. Precisely - 16 thousand and 44. In 92 days. But it is clear that there are hundreds and hundreds of times more feats and victories of our defenders. I am grateful to everyone who holds the defense. Who helps the army and all our defenders. And finally. Usually these days in May we celebrate the last bell in schools and congratulate boys and girls on the beginning of a new stage in life. Frankly, a brighter stage than childhood. Because finally opportunities in life emerge. Adult opportunities. But childhood is still not over yet. This year there is no traditional school holiday in Ukraine. And this is understandable. Such a time. Such a situation. And not all schools in Ukraine finish the education process in May this year. And not all graduates are now in our country. But the constant thing is whatever the time and whatever the situation, we must not lose our opportunities. We have to fight. We have to develop. We have to defend our freedom and be able to use that freedom. So, we have to be educated and brave. Don't lose a single day in your life. Know what you live the day for. And be sure to believe in Ukraine. Because it is here that Ukrainians have the best chance of success. And especially - after our victory. Which we will definitely gain. And we will definitely remove the phrase ""temporarily occupied"" in relation to our land, which will be liberated forever. No matter how difficult it may be. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"First of all, thank you for such kind words, thank you for your arrival, thank you for this support. Dear deputies of the Saeima! Dear Latvian people! I am glad to have the opportunity to address you today and, above all, to thank you for all the help that Ukraine has received from the Republic of Latvia and from many ordinary citizens of Latvia. You perceive our struggle for freedom as your own struggle. And this is true - because right now in Ukraine the fate of all of us, all Europeans, is being decided. It is the strength of weapons in the war that Russia has launched against our country, against Ukraine, and at the same time against the freedom of all its neighbors, that determines what will dominate in Europe for decades to come. Either it will be justice for every nation we strive for with you, or Russia will manage to make the words ""occupation"", ""repression"", ""deportation"" main again for different nations. I am grateful to you for the determination you’ve stood up for justice with. As early as 6 pm on February 23, ""Stingers"" from Latvia arrived in Ukraine. The weapons we received from you, from the first hours of Russia's full-scale aggression, began to save the lives of our people. While many others hesitated, looking for excuses, you were among those who acted. And continue to help us to the maximum now. In the defense sphere, with the support for sanctions, humanitarian support and extremely warm attitude to our citizens who have found temporary shelter in Latvia. Ukraine will always remember your help. I am grateful to you for this, grateful for this help! So why did it happen that someone resolutely chooses the path of action and support, and someone does everything to really do nothing? Why can those who do not have great resources show great courage, and some quite powerful actors in global relations do not find in themselves a percentage of the power you have? Why can they tolerate criticism for cowardice, double standards and hypocrisy, even accusations of direct indulging in Russian aggression just to stay away and maintain contacts with Russia? There are various answers to these questions. Of course, often the answer is just money. There are those who are just looking for benefits and are able to think only about profits, interest and account statements. There are those who hope in vain that they will be able to pacify Russia if they remain silent and do not really fight aggression. But, in fact, these are not decisive factors. They are an add-on. The basis of everything is contempt for values. There are people - and many of them among the powerful of this world - who believe that not all nations matter. Who believe that a nation can simply be forgotten to try to keep peace. Even the temporary peace, even the illusory one. Even peace at the cost of tens of thousands killed, hundreds of thousands deported or millions deprived of their homeland. They are OK with that. Peace at the cost of the lives of others. But this should not be normal! In the past - and even in the very recent past - this disrespect for certain nations has led to terrible and insidious conspiracies and pacts that deprived statehood, destroyed borders and inflamed the appetite for war. Millions of people died because of it. The lives of generations have been poisoned. And it seemed that at least Europe and the Western world drew conclusions from their experience. But now we hear again that Russia should be given what it wants. That supposedly it is necessary to accept that some nations may be deprived of part of their foreign policy rights, because certain, as they say, ""historical force"" wants it. There are quite serious talks about drawing some dividing lines along the body of a sovereign state in order to allegedly ""appease"" the aggressor. And allegedly concessions, concessions and concessions again are needed - of course, at the expense of the state, which was attacked, so that the aggressor allegedly mercifully stops. And this is about Ukraine, which has been defending itself for the fourth month already in a full-scale war against the second strongest army in the world. And what will happen if Russia starts a war against states that have less internal potential for defense than Ukraine? Will the world help such states? Or will they be given up without any disputes at all? And it's not just some speculation - it's a reality. This is our reality. In Russia, they openly say that they will not stop in Ukraine. They need the Baltic states, Poland and other European countries. That is why we must restore full respect for the fundamental values on our continent. We must fight absolutely clearly and at all levels for the principle: every nation matters. The interests of any nation cannot be ignored, betrayed or exchanged for something in a relationship with those who want to make that nation dependent on themselves. When this principle is truly respected by all, in full, then European unity will work. And then Russia will stand no chance either in the war against Ukraine or in the war against any other European country. When Ukraine is told that we should not be given all the weapons we need to win, they actually mean that our nation is allegedly less important than other nations who have already been given or can use such weapons. When we are told that we have to give away part of our land because it is supposed to be a ""necessary compromise"", it means that our people are considered less worthy of having their interests taken into account. Moreover, when they ask us to wait “a little longer” in the European Union's reception room - years or decades - not agreeing to give us full membership, and some still doubt the candidate status for Ukraine, it only emphasizes that the principle of respect for every nation does not work. And it must work. Because if Russia starts a war, say, against any state, God forbid Latvia, all NATO members will have to decide whether to defend Latvia. If Russia provokes an emergency crisis on the borders or inside a country of the European Union, all EU members will have to decide whether to provide help. And what will they be able to decide if there is no respect for each nation? We must do our best to never see the obvious answer to the question asked this way. Ladies and Gentlemen! On March 1, at a meeting in Riga Castle, a decision was made to award me the Order of Viesturs of the first degree - the highest award of the Republic of Latvia. It is a great honor for me. But I perceive this as a distinction not of my personal activity, but of our common struggle. The struggle of the Ukrainian people for independence. The struggle of the Latvian people for freedom in Europe. The struggle of all Europeans, who truly respect our common values, for Europe to be truly strong and truly united. We need this unity to guarantee the security of both Ukraine and every other state that may be threatened by Russian aggression. We need the strength and unity of Europe for Russia to pay for this war - to pay the full price, in particular through sanctions and the confiscation of its assets. Having experienced these losses, it must learn that war creates the greatest problems for the aggressor first of all. It is necessary not only to finally agree on the sixth sanctions package against the Russian Federation, including the embargo on oil, oil blends and petroleum products. But also to prepare the seventh sanctions package - with even more powerful restrictions on Russia for terror against Ukraine. Just like Latvia, the whole of Europe must restrict Russia's energy weapons. Fully. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Latvian people! Our parents hoped that the war would not hit our generation. That you and I would not be threatened by what previous generations had to endure. Occupation, repression, deportation… We have everything we need to eliminate these threats. And I'm sure we'll do it. Together. And guided by our values. Paldies, Latvija! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! I started this day by talking to the participants of the Ukrainian Breakfast, which took place within the Davos Forum. I want to say something about why I take part in such events, and what others are saying, particularly in Davos this year. The world turned out not to be ready for Ukrainian bravery. For the bravery of all our people who are not inferior to Russia and continue to defend our state. Remember how it all began on February 24, when many in the world did not even believe that Ukraine would be able to withstand a full-scale war. Was that so? It was. And why was that so? Not because all these people who doubted were equally mistaken when assessing the potential of our state. But because many of them did not even begin to assess. Many of them simply did not want to take Ukraine into account. There was no such habit - to take Ukraine into account. Although they have a habit of taking Russia into account. Even when there are no objective reasons for this. It is convenient for them. And really habitual. Often very profitable. Calling certain Russian politicians ""Dostoevsky's heroes"", as if it serves as an excuse for them. Talking about the alleged historical sphere of influence of Russia. And about the alleged balance in relations in Europe, which is allegedly impossible without Russia. No matter what the Russian state does, there is always someone who says: let's take its interests into account. This year in Davos it was heard again. Despite thousands of Russian missiles hitting Ukraine. Despite tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed. Despite Bucha and Mariupol, etc. Despite the destroyed cities. And despite the ""filtration camps"" built by the Russian state, in which they kill, torture, rape and humiliate like on a conveyor belt. Russia has done all this in Europe. Symptomatic editorials began to appear in some Western media stating that Ukraine must allegedly accept so-called difficult compromises by giving up territory in exchange for peace. Perhaps The New York Times in 1938 also wrote something similar. But now, let me remind you, it is 2022. And behind all these geopolitical speculations of those who advise Ukraine to give away something to Russia, ""great geopoliticians"" are always unwilling to see ordinary people. Ordinary Ukrainians. Millions of those who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace. You must always see people. And remember that values are not just a word. That is why I pay such attention to international platforms, addresses to parliamentarians, to parliaments, to the people of other countries, to communication with the expert community, with journalists, with students. We must do everything possible for the world to get a permanent habit of taking Ukraine into account. So that the interests of Ukrainians are not overlapped by the interests of those who are in a hurry for another meeting with the dictator. That's why I always have a lot of international communication in my schedule. Yesterday and today - Davos. Tomorrow - the Parliament of Latvia. The day after tomorrow - Stanford and Indonesia. Then - just as actively. I spoke with Austrian Chancellor Nehammer. I informed him about the situation in Donbas and other areas of hostilities. Expressed gratitude for the support. We agreed that Austria would take our severely wounded servicemen for treatment. Cooperation in the European integration of Ukraine was discussed in detail. I also spoke with the President of Liberia today. The main topic of conversation was the counteraction to the food crisis provoked by the Russian Federation. Expressed gratitude for the support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity, in particular at the UN platform. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and all those who defend the state are resisting the extremely fierce offensive of Russian troops in the east. In some areas, the enemy is substantially superior in terms of equipment, number of soldiers. The Russian authorities have made an illustrative decision - they have allowed to hire older people for contract service. That is, they no longer have enough young people, but the desire to fight still remains. It still takes time to discourage them from this. We still need the help of partners, especially weapons for Ukraine. Total help! No exceptions, no restrictions. Enough to win. That's what those who really value people are talking about. And I am grateful to everyone who spoke about it, including in Davos. Who talks about it in the media and in the capitals of leading countries. Despite pressure from all those stuck in the XX century, when the interests of nations were indeed often traded for attempts to appease the appetites of dictators. I signed a decree today on awarding our heroes. 144 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 17 of them posthumously. And, of course, I would like to congratulate the communications service employees on their professional day - the Day of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine. This is one of the most sensitive areas in modern warfare. Our joint success directly depends on the quality of your work, dear communications service employees. The success of our entire state. By my decree, I conferred the military rank of brigadier general upon three colonels of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection. I am grateful to everyone who defends the state! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Strong people of our bravest country! All our defenders! The third month of our defense is over. This is a long time. A term not foreseen by the world's leading intelligence agencies. This was not even assumed by our enemies. And this is what motivates the world to look at our land, Ukraine, in a completely different way. This is three months of war crimes of the Russian occupiers. Three months of their strikes, destruction, blockade. And three months of mass exploits of our people who are defending their own land, their own country. 15,227 Ukrainian men and women were awarded state awards. 12,550 of them are servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 1801 warriors of the National Guard. 205 border guards. 182 police officers. 167 employees of the Security Service of Ukraine. 138 representatives of the State Emergency Service. 99 representatives of the Main Intelligence Directorate. 38 employees of the State Special Communications Service. And also - employees of the Department of State Protection, the Foreign Intelligence Service, NABU, SBI and the Judicial Protection Service, who also contributed to our defense. 155 Ukrainians were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine, 75 of them posthumously. 1016 settlements of Ukraine have already been de-occupied. And each of these figures is a story. A story of extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice. This is the heroic defense of Mariupol. These are stories of success in the battles for Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv. This is a heroic defense in Donbas. This is the defense of Odesa, Mykolaiv and our entire south. These are protests and resistance in those cities and communities of Ukraine that we have yet to liberate. We must always remember that we have survived these three months thanks to the tens of thousands of feats of all those who defend the state. And at the cost of tens of thousands of lives of Ukrainian men and women killed by the occupiers. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Another completely inadequate statement was made from Russia today that they were allegedly ""slowing down"" the offensive on purpose. Well, after three months of searching for an explanation why they failed to break Ukraine in three days, they came up with nothing better than to claim that they had allegedly planned to do so. Almost 30,000 Russian soldiers killed. More than 200 downed aircraft. Thousands of lost Russian tanks, armored vehicles and other equipment. Russian missile ammunition is almost completely used up. And they want to cover it up with lies that they are not fighting at full strength? Miserably. And the time will come when they themselves will admit it. Now the situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. In fact, all the strength the Russian army still has was thrown there to attack. Lyman, Popasna, Severodonetsk, Slovyansk - the occupiers want to destroy everything there. But in the interceptions of their conversations, we hear that they are well aware that this war does not make sense for Russia and that strategically their army stands no chance. But it takes time and still a lot of extraordinary efforts by our people to break their advantage in the amount of equipment and weapons. I am grateful to all the partners of Ukraine who help. But I emphasize again and again: the longer this war lasts, the greater will be the price of protecting freedom not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole free world. Therefore, the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine - MLRS, tanks, anti-ship and other weapons - is the best investment in maintaining stability in the world and preventing many severe crises that Russia is still planning or has already provoked. We continue to work to ensure that Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees after this war. In particular, an international advisory group headed by Yermak and former NATO Secretary General Rasmussen has been set up. The group will include leading experts in the fields of security and defense, diplomacy. Their task is to develop a format of guarantees that will really work. And not for several months or years, but during the lifetime of many generations of our Ukrainians. I spoke today with President of the European Council Charles Michel. At the end of May, an important meeting of the European Council will be held on assistance to Ukraine. So we coordinated our positions. In particular, on strengthening sanctions on Russia. I also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. First of all, about the defense support for Ukraine. About further political cooperation and providing our state with all the assistance, including financial, which is so necessary to beat the occupiers. I held a meeting with the leaders of the Crimean direction of our policy. In particular, with Tamila Tasheva, Permanent Representative of the President of Ukraine to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The Russian invasion began in Crimea. This was not the first item on the list of mistakes of the Russian state towards Ukraine, but the first fateful one for Russia itself. It is from this point that the following, no less fateful mistakes of Russia came, which all together will lead to its historical weakening. And, of course, the occupiers will have to leave Crimea, too. As well as Kherson, Melitopol, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all other cities and communities where they still pretend to be the masters. They will definitely not be the masters there. I am grateful to each and everyone who helps bring this time of liberation of our territory and peace closer. I am grateful to all our military, intelligence officers, border guards, sappers, rescuers, doctors, nurses, police officers, National Guard, communications service employees, diplomats, volunteers, journalists, all transport workers, Ukrzaliznytsia, workers of the energy sector. To everyone who provides logistics. To everyone who organizes the evacuation. To everyone who restores life in the liberated territory. To everyone who continues to teach pupils, to teach students. To everyone who keeps business and, consequently, jobs for our citizens. To everyone who works, saves, helps and promotes Ukrainian interests in the world. I am grateful to everyone who decided to be with Ukraine on February 24. We will definitely win! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Every day, addressing our people, I emphasize how difficult and at what cost it is to defend against Russian aggression. The occupiers are waging a very brutal war against us. Indeed, there has been no such war on the European continent for 77 years. Total war. When the enemy tries to destroy as many people and infrastructure as possible. The clearance of debris in Desna in the Chernihiv region has been completed. 87 dead. And these were only four missiles. In total, since February 24, the Russian army has launched 1,474 missile strikes at Ukraine, using 2,275 different missiles. The vast majority was aimed at civilian objects. In less than three months, there have been more than 3,000 air strikes by Russian aircraft and helicopters. What other country has withstood such a scale of strikes? Every time we tell our partners that we need modern anti-missile weapons, modern combat aircraft, we are not just making a formal request. We say that our request is the real lives of many people who would not have died if we had received all the weapons we are asking for. By the way, today, talking to the participants of the Davos Forum, which began its work, I spoke in particular about this. About the need to provide Ukraine with everything it needs to save the lives of our people. All our partners agree that Ukraine's struggle in the war against Russia is the protection of the common values of all countries in the free world. Our common freedom. And if so, then we have the right to count on full and urgent assistance, especially weapons. My every international negotiations, every address to parliaments or other foreign audiences is necessarily related to this topic. And I am grateful to all those partners who help and provide us with the necessary weapons and ammunition to overcome the advantage of the Russian army, especially in the amount of equipment and weapons. The most difficult fighting situation today is in Donbas. Bakhmut, Popasna, Severodonetsk - in this direction the occupiers have concentrated the greatest activity so far. They organized a massacre there and are trying to destroy everything living there. Literally. Nobody destroyed Donbas as much as the Russian army does now. And I am grateful to all our warriors who are holding their positions and have the courage to counterattack. Today in Kyiv, at the Mariyinsky Palace in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine, I presented the Orders of the Golden Star. To the warriors, as well as to the relatives of those of our Heroes who were posthumously awarded. In particular, to the sister of sailor Vitaliy Skakun. He was a sapper of the 137th Separate Marine Battalion of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrogradsky. He died performing a combat mission in southern Ukraine. Thanks to his courage and heroism, we managed to significantly delay the offensive of the overwhelming forces of the enemy and save hundreds of lives of our soldiers. In this war - both from February 24 and from 2014 - the Marines proved their extraordinary bravery. They were among those units that heroically defended Mariupol. They took part in many important battles.  And today - on the Day of the Marines - I express my sincere gratitude to all those who defend the state in these troops. The Russian occupiers are trying very hard to show that they allegedly will not give up the occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, the Kherson region, the occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhia region and Donbas. They are going on the offensive in some areas. Reserves are being accumulated in some areas. Somewhere they are trying to reinforce their positions. The coming weeks of the war will be difficult. And we must be aware of that. Yet we have no alternative but to fight. Fight and win. Free our land and our people. Because the occupiers want to take away from us not just something, but everything we have. Including the right to life for Ukrainians. However, to win, each and every one of us must work for it. And including those in the rear. Help the army. Protect the needs of our state in all international platforms to which you have access, in communication with foreign journalists, even just with your friends and acquaintances abroad. Every vote counts. Today, as every day, I worked to increase the pressure on Russia. Our representatives in Davos are working to give Ukraine more financial and humanitarian support. And for all diplomats of our state the absolute priority is weapons and ammunition for our state. In the evening I signed a decree on awarding our warriors. 161 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 42 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to everyone who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all who are bringing our victory closer! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear President Cassis, Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear attendees! I am grateful for this opportunity to take part in the discussion at the Forum. The general theme of Davos this year is: History at a Turning Point: Government Policies and Business Strategies. And this year the words ""turning point"" are not just a rhetorical figure. This is really the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world. If it reigns, our thoughts won’t matter to it. And we may no longer convene in Davos. Because what for? Brute force seeks nothing but the subjugation of those it wants to subdue. And it does not discuss, but kills at once, as Russia is doing in Ukraine right now, right at this time when we are talking. By the way, please look at the building of the former Russian House in Davos. It has been turned into a house of Russian war crimes. And this is an example of their transformation. What Russia has done to itself by becoming a state of war crimes. And what it brings to the world. Inspiring other potential aggressors. Instead of successful peaceful cities - black ruins. Instead of normal trade - mined sea and blocked ports in Ukraine. Instead of tourism - closed skies and thousands of Russian bombs and cruise missiles. This is what the world will look like if humanity misses this turning point. It will look like a very large collection of war crimes. So, history remembers many moments when everything changed dramatically. It remembers, for example, how just a few shots can lead to millions of casualties. If these were the shots on June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo. History remembers how much grief one person’s evil can cause if he sees that he is not being resisted enough. As it was, for example, in 1938 in Munich. Historical twists were noticeable and not as much. But it was always necessary to react to them. Trying to prepare for other historical upheavals - as they say, to soften the blow. Or - trying to heal the wounds of catastrophes that were behind one or another historical turn. And now we have a large collection of such reactions: the UN Charter with all units of the Organization, the OSCE, the IAEA, the WTO and many, many other important institutions. But are they enough to respond to what we are facing today? And is it enough now to try to adapt those institutions to modern challenges? Definitely not. We need to change the approach. Not to react, but to act. And act preventively. And not only to adapt what we have to the new realities, but also to create new tools. New precedents. Look at what Ukraine has already done. We have set a historical precedent for courage. Without listening to those who said that our defense would not last longer than a few days. We have stopped the Russian army, which was called the second in the world, and at the cost of heavy fighting and thousands of lives, we are gradually driving the occupiers out of our land. But would we have to do that if we had been listened to last year and if the full range of sanctions that can knock down any aggressor had been applied fairly and preventively against the Russian Federation? I'm sure the answer is “no”. Preventing war would be guaranteed if the world's actions had been preventive rather than responsive. Ukraine has set another precedent in these three months. A precedent for the unprecedented unity of the democratic world around the emotion of genuine admiration for Ukrainian courage and around the understanding that freedom must be fought for. And now hundreds of millions of people in democracies are putting pressure, supporting and putting pressure on the governments and companies to limit relations with the aggressor state, Russia, and to help the people they have attacked. But this is happening only now, although Russia started a war against Ukraine in 2014. We are grateful for such support, but if it had happened then - immediately - this unity and this pressure on governments, on companies for the struggle for freedom, would Russia have started this full-scale war and inflicted all these losses to Ukraine and the world? I am sure that the answer to this question is “no” as well. Now we see that the world listens and believes Ukraine. But there is also a certain expectation in the world how this situation will be resolved. What tools will work? What new can we create to prevent such aggressions? And how do we stop the brute force that has challenged everything we really value? That's what a turning point means. Ladies and Gentlemen! Don't wait for the fatal strikes. Don't wait until Russia uses special weapons - chemical, biological and, God forbid, nuclear. Do not give the aggressor the impression that the world will not show enough resistance. Protect freedom and normal, useful for all peaceful order in the world immediately and in full! That's what sanctions should be. Maximum. So that Russia and every other potential aggressor who wants to wage a brutal war against a neighbor knows exactly what this is leading to. And I think there are no such sanctions against Russia yet. And they must be imposed. Russian oil embargo. Complete blocking of all banks without exception - all. Complete abandonment of the Russian IT sector. Complete cessation of trade with the aggressor. This should be a precedent of sanctions pressure that will work convincingly for decades to maintain peace. It is necessary to set a precedent for the complete exit of all foreign businesses from the Russian market. So that your brands are not associated with war crimes. That your offices, accounts, commodities are not used by war criminals in their bloody interests. Values must matter. Especially since everyone suffers losses when a full-scale war begins and global markets are destabilized due to someone’s neglect of values. For our part, we offer every company that leaves the Russian market to continue operating in Ukraine. You will get access not only to our market of 40 million consumers, but also to the common market of Europe. And at the same time - your brands, positions will only be enhanced due to the fact that you really support the protection of freedom. Our representatives here in Davos can inform each and every one of you about the details of the prospects that Ukraine opens for businesses. Ladies and Gentlemen! We offer the world to set a precedent for rebuilding the country after the war, which will show everyone who dreams of destroying the life of a neighbor that the war doesn’t bring the expected result. I invite you to take part in this reconstruction. The amount of work is enormous. We have more than half a trillion dollars in losses. Tens of thousands of objects were destroyed. We need to rebuild entire cities, entire industries. And we offer a special - historically significant - model of reconstruction. When each of the partner countries or partner cities or partner companies will have the opportunity - historical one - to take patronage over a particular region of Ukraine, city, community or industry. Britain, Denmark, the European Union and other leading international actors have already chosen a specific direction for patronage in reconstruction. Thanks to this model of relations, post-war reconstruction can be fast, efficient and high-quality. And this will not only attract the world's best specialists - architects, engineers, builders, developers, managers and others. It will also be the largest opportunity for economic leap in Europe since World War II. By the way, given the presence of President Cassis today, I would like to thank Switzerland for organizing this Conference in Lugano and supporting our efforts. However the list of new precedents needed will not be complete without a few more important decisions. There must be a precedent of punishment for the aggressor and investment in a peaceful life. Russian assets scattered in different jurisdictions must be found, arrested or frozen, and then confiscated and sent to a special Fund from which all victims of this war can receive compensation. Of course, this is not easy. But after that, there will be no motivation left for the various aggressors to do what Russia has done and continues to do. If the aggressor loses everything, it definitely deprives him of motivation to start a war. Let's move on. Any response to the mass famine is overdue by definition. The famine should be stopped only preventively - when it has not yet begun. But now there is no such tool in the world. We propose to create an organization of responsible and democratic food-exporting states that can act with respect for human rights and global trade rules. Our motivation is very simple. Whatever the turning points in history, humanity must have insurance against famine. And Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for the activities of such a new organization - a definitely needed one. And the last point. You know, this war of Russia against Ukraine convinces everyone that aid to the attacked state is more valuable the sooner it is provided. Weapons, finances, political support, sanctions against Russia - if we had received them one hundred percent of our needs in February, the result would be tens of thousands of lives saved. That is why Ukraine needs all the weapons we ask for, not just the ones we are given. That is why Ukraine needs finances. That's at least $ 5 billion a month. And all the funds needed for reconstruction. That is why the United24 Ukraine Recovery Fund was established. And we encourage you to join the support using this platform. Ukrainian state platform. For each donor, we give a specific proposal - how to help and where to send funds. Where the priority is now. The target nature of the work is an absolute priority. And in the future, under this brand, United24, we propose to create a global structure that can provide sufficient support within 24 hours for any country that has suffered a military attack, natural disaster or, for example, a pandemic. That is, we offer a new format of security guarantees. Based on what we went through. What we are going through now. There must be something that sets a precedent of absolutely timely assistance. To everyone who needs it. To preserve peace, to preserve life, to preserve social stability. That is, all the necessary elements for a normal economy. Like, for example, the 911 service, there must be a United24 that guarantees security on a global scale. Ladies and Gentlemen! George Marshall, a well-remembered man, said in 1947: ""Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist."" These words are still relevant today. My proposals are directed in the same way - against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. And of course against the war unleashed by Russia, which brings nothing but hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. To many in the world. Not just us. Therefore, in order to guarantee peace and tranquility, we must all act quickly and preventively. We must not be afraid to set new precedents. This is exactly what the world has long had to learn at various turning points, for which it paid a high price. This was the price for the fact that the world only reacted, not acted preventively. So, now we can do it differently. Finally in the right way. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today was a real Polish day. I was glad to welcome the President of our fraternal Poland and my friend Andrzej Duda in Kyiv. First, on May 3, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson addressed our Verkhovna Rada online. And today - already personally - there was the President of Poland. And, by the way, this line of cooperation - Ukraine - Poland, Ukraine - Britain was really very effective and remains so during this war. I am glad to note that Ukrainian-Polish relations are finally on a completely clean, sincere basis, without any quarrels and old conflict heritage. This is an achievement. The historical achievement of our nations. And I want the brotherhood between Ukrainians and Poles to be preserved forever. As I said about this today to the deputies: for our unity, the unity of Ukrainians and Poles, to be a constant value that no one will violate. I signed a decree on the introduction of a new award of Ukraine - to thank those cities of partner countries that have helped the most. And Rzeszów became the first such city. The rescuer city. Quite rightly. Another decision I announced today is the preparation of a bill that will be a mirror image of the law on our citizens, Ukrainians, passed in Poland. What is this law? Ukrainian men and women temporarily staying in Poland fleeing the war have de facto and de jure been given the same opportunities as Poles. And it will be the right gesture to pass such a law in Ukraine. Let it be so that the citizens of Poland will never have to use such a law. But let us show our gratitude and our respect. And I also want it to be part of our new neighborhood policy. We must resolve disputes and remove the pressure of the past from our current relations with all Ukraine's neighbors who respect us and are not occupiers of our state. A decision has been reached that is revolutionizing the order on our border. We are introducing joint customs control with Poland. This will significantly speed up border procedures. It will remove most of the corruption risks. But it is also the beginning of our integration into the common customs space of the European Union. That is a truly historical process. Of course, Andrzej and I also talked today about the defense support for Ukraine. And about strengthening sanctions against Russia. And about the steps we need to take to achieve our common goal - full membership of Ukraine in the EU. I am grateful to Andrzej and all the Polish people for the fact that we are going along this path as quickly as possible. In the evening I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I told Boris about our meeting, about the negotiations, about the situation on the battlefield. We are looking for ways to increase the volume of our exports, especially agricultural products. As well as the volume of fuel imports to Ukraine. I am preparing to start a new week of maximum diplomatic activity in the interests of our state. On Monday I will join the discussions at the Davos Forum. This is the world's most influential economic platform where Ukraine has something to say. There will be other public speeches during the week, including an address to the Stanford University community. As well as a special format of communication with the political and expert communities of Indonesia. Of course, the schedule also includes a large number of contacts at the bilateral level with representatives of various states and international organizations. Our state expands its international ties every week to get everything it needs to end the war as soon as possible. There will be a new meeting of representatives of the partner countries - ""Ramstein-2"", if we call this group after the place of the first meeting in Germany. We look forward to new useful decisions for our defense. I signed a decree on awarding our military. 194 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 44 of them posthumously. Everyone should always remember these people. Those who give their lives for Ukraine. So that all generations of our people can live freely and choose independently with whom to be friends, whom to respect and what values to pass on to their children. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to each and every one whose lives were taken by the Russian invaders. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear Chairman, presidium. Dear people's deputies of Ukraine, Dear guests. Andrzej. Ladies and Gentlemen! Guest in the house, God in the house. This is a Polish proverb with which I greet in Kyiv our guest, friend and brother, President of Poland Andrzej Duda. This folk wisdom tells that each of your guests is a grace of God. And this is the worldview according to which the Poles from the very beginning of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, Russia's war against Ukraine, sheltered millions of our citizens - citizens of Ukraine. Our women, our children, the elderly and everyone else whose door was knocked on on February 24 by completely different guests. Guests whom we never wanted to have and who have other proverbs and other folk wisdom. Russia has been proving this ""otherness"" for 88 days. 88 days of madness: their missiles, bombs, projectiles fly into houses, schools, hospitals, museums, theaters, temples, even cemeteries. At the same time, without realizing it, on February 24, Russia destroyed something else as well. A kind of ""repository"" of past contradictions between Ukraine and Poland. They no longer exist. In a day it became clear that all these contradictions have no force when there is the force of such a threat. Threat to the survival of our nations - Ukraine, Poland, the nations of Europe. Andrzej and I sought a true understanding between our nations, and together we dismantled this ""repository."" We planned to build a Memorial of Reconciliation on the common border of Ukraine and Poland. But those who want other memorials, dedicated not to peace at all, have crossed Ukrainian borders.  February 24 changed everything. It changed our nations. Changed our countries. Although this is not accidental. I do not know whether our astronomers Drohobych and Copernicus studied this phenomenon, but the stars are always formed in such a way that during the most difficult periods of eclipse Ukrainians and Poles unite and stand side by side, despite past quarrels and ""nebulae"". We are defending a common universe for us called freedom and independence, at a time when someone is committing barbarism of a cosmic scale. Today the understanding, interaction, friendship and brotherhood of Ukraine and Poland reach the same scale. On February 24, we began writing a new volume of our history. Our common history - it is important. The unity of our nations must last forever. It must never again be dishonored by enmity. St. John Paul II called the incitement of hatred between us a blatant anachronism unworthy of our two great nations. In various letters to our nations, the Pontiff said: “The new millennium requires that Ukrainians and Poles not remain enslaved by sad memories of the past. By committing to a better future for all, let them look at each other with a look of reconciliation. Our two nations have experienced so much bitterness and pain over the past few decades. Let this experience serve as purification. Let everyone be willing to put what unites above what divides. Look for something that cures. So that together they may build a future based on mutual respect, brotherhood, fraternal cooperation and true solidarity."" Learn to appreciate, distinguish, choose. Ukraine and Poland have chosen one path. This path. On it we learned to distinguish enemies and appreciate friends. Appreciate each other and most importantly - respect. The time that Jerzy Giedroyc and Bohdan Osadchuk dreamed of has come. About which Juliusz Słowacki, whose monument stands in Kyiv, and Taras Shevchenko, whose monument stands in Warsaw, wrote. Today, half a word is enough for Polish President Andrzej and I to understand each other. Our parliaments, our governments and our nations in general understand each other as never before. And it doesn't matter whether it is Cyrillic or Latin, it doesn't matter how we write the words ""freedom"" and ""independence"". It is important that Ukrainians and Poles say these things in the same way. And are equally ready to defend them. Ukraine is already doing this. On the very frontline. It defends not just itself but the whole of Europe. Poles know this, appreciate, respect and help Ukraine - not out of courtesy, but as brothers and allies who remember Lech Kaczyński's words about who could be next. This does not mean fear. This means readiness to face the enemy and repel him. That is why, for example, we have the same perception of the sanctions policy against the Russian Federation. We know that half-measures cannot be used when aggression needs to be stopped. Now. Poland is one of the leaders not only in supporting our state, but also in defending and promoting the sanctions that are absolutely necessary to force Russia into peace. The absolute majority of Poles support the embargo on energy resources from Russia. This is just one manifestation - but how important it is - of our common vision of the political front in this war. I believe that Poland's leadership will help establish at the European level what our nations already understand. The unity of our nations must remain constant. Neither now nor in the future does anyone have the right to break this unity. Neither our politicians, nor hostile agents, nor even members of the jury at Eurovision. The Ukrainian and Polish nations gave each other 12 points - today and forever. I want to thank all Poles for their support. I want to remember everyone from this rostrum. So that every voivodeship, powiat and gmina hears this. Whose support and help is felt in every region, every city, village, in every community of Ukraine. Thank you, Warsaw, Kraków. Thank you, Łódź, Poznań, Wrocław. Thank you Gdańsk, Bydgoszcz, Toruń. Thank you, Lublin, Katowice, Opole, Szczecin. Gorzów Wielkopolski, Zielona Góra. Thank you, Rzeszów, Białystok, Olsztyn, Kielce. These are sister cities of our cities - Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Kremenchuk, Kryvyi Rih, Cherkasy, Luhansk, Donetsk, Sumy, Izyum, Starobilsk, Mariupol. Almost all our cities are sister cities of those in Poland. Our nations are also brothers. Our countries are sisters. We are relatives. And there should be no borders or barriers between us. The Ukrainian and Polish nations have not been mentally separated for a long time. So we agreed to implement this in the near future in the relevant bilateral agreement. First on joint border and customs control, and later on the conditional border when Ukraine becomes a member of the European Union. And I am sure that all the necessary decisions will be made first for the status of a candidate for Ukraine, and then for full membership. In particular, thanks to Poland's many years of protection of Ukrainian interests on the European continent. And I am grateful for your willingness - for your willingness personally, Andrzej - to pay a visit to European capitals together with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová to lobby for Ukraine's membership in the European Union in countries - as they say, ""skeptics"". In fact, they are not skeptics, but future optimists. This is how I see our common very important task in this direction. Separately, I thank the Polish Sejm for the recently adopted law on assistance to the citizens of Ukraine. This is a completely unprecedented decision, according to which our citizens, who were forced to move temporarily to Poland due to the aggression of the Russian Federation, will receive almost the same rights and opportunities as Polish citizens. Legal residence, employment, education, medical care, social guarantees. This is a great step, a great gesture of a great soul, which only a great friend of Ukraine is capable of. And this step will not remain unilateral. I believe that in the near future we must submit to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a similar - mirror - bill. God forbid that Polish citizens will ever need all these advantages in such conditions, in conditions of war. But these laws are of great symbolic significance. They show that Ukrainians and Poles are native and equal. And I am sure that the parliamentary corps of Ukraine will support this law - quickly and, I am sure, by a majority of votes. In addition, before this speech, I signed a decree noting the special role of the Polish city of Rzeszów. I have introduced a special honorary title of ""rescuer city"" for the partner cities of our state, which today do the impossible to help us, to help our people, to help our army. On behalf of the entire Ukrainian people, I would like to express great gratitude to the city of Rzeszów, the first rescuer city. I also want to thank Polish cultural figures, sportsmen, clergy and ordinary people who support us - organize big concerts, take part in competitions with the Ukrainian ribbon, or come from Poznań to Bucha just to bake bread. I believe that soon Ukrainians and Poles will gather at one big table to share this bread. Share the feelings - the most important feelings - of peace. Share the taste of victory. Victory of Ukraine. Joint victory. And raise a toast to your and our freedom. Without a free Ukraine, there can be no free Poland. I know historians often argue about who was the first to say this, who was the author of this phrase. We have resolved this dispute - this is the will of the Ukrainian and Polish nations. Thank you brothers! Together until the end. Niech żyje Polska! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! This day in our state has a double meaning. This is Science Day. And Europe Day. I congratulate our scientists, who, despite all the difficulties, nevertheless work to ensure that Ukraine preserves and develops its scientific potential. Of course, during a full-scale war, all the forces of society and the state can be aimed only at protection. And these are significant limitations for science, for the cultural sphere, for other fundamental parts of public life. But such is the time we live in. We are doing everything we can to return to the rules of peacetime as soon as possible. I would also like to express my gratitude to all those who are working to make Ukraine a part of a united Europe. To all our diplomats, to all our civil servants who now have a few weeks to complete the task that other countries have been overcoming for years when joining the European Union. And I want to emphasize that our European integration path is not just about politics. It's about quality of life. And about the fact that Ukrainians perceive the values of life in the same way as the vast majority of Europeans. I held talks with the Prime Minister of Portugal in Kyiv today. I thanked him for all the support that Portugal is currently providing to Ukraine. This is defense, political and humanitarian support. I am grateful for the warm treatment of our people who have taken refuge in Portugal. Further sanctions against the Russian Federation were discussed with the Prime Minister. And also - post-war reconstruction of our state. Portugal is ready to join the reconstruction of Ukraine, the reconstruction of Ukrainian schools and kindergartens. And I want to remind you that during the full-scale war, the Russian army has already destroyed 1873 educational institutions. This is a colossal scale of losses. But when a united Europe, American leadership and the whole free world stand with you, you can overcome that as well. I am grateful to President Biden for the immediate signing of the $ 40 billion support package for Ukraine approved by the US Congress. This is a historic contribution to the protection of freedom in Europe. I also spoke today with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. The main focus was on the situation on the battlefield and how Ukraine's victory can be brought closer. We agreed that the sixth package of sanctions against Russia should be accelerated. I am grateful for Italy's full support on our path to the European Union. The military situation has not changed significantly today. But it was really hard. Actually, the fact that we are able to say this on the 87th day of a full-scale war against Russia is good news. Russia has sent virtually all its resources to destroy us. In the Russian regions, it is openly said that their so-called ""special operation"" is the cause of the economic downturn - in particular, in the industries such as construction and many others. And also the reason for the impoverishment of people, which may be even greater than in the 1990s. Rising prices, devaluation of income, destruction of all the economic potential that has been created in Russia since the 2000s - all this does not stop the invaders yet. But the colossal costs of the war still do not help them. And will not help. The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. As in previous days, the Russian army is trying to attack Slovyansk and Severodonetsk. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring this offensive. Every day that our defenders take away from these offensive plans of Russia, disrupting them, is a concrete contribution to the approach of the main day. The desired day that we are all looking forward to and fighting for. Victory Day. And no Russian strikes - neither by missiles in the Rivne region, nor by artillery in the Kharkiv or Sumy region, nor by all possible weapons in Donbas - will give Russia any result. Today I signed a decree on awarding our heroes. 215 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 30 of them posthumously. Almost every day I have such decrees on my desk. On awarding our defenders. On conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine. And this reflects the severity of the military situation. Unfortunately, the war continues. The war is not over. We still need to fight and move towards victory. Maybe someone in the rear cities thinks that one can forget about the war. And become carefree. Or even careless. It isn’t so. Every day Ukrainians die for our independence. Every day! And each and every one of us must take care of our defense on a daily basis. With anything they can. In a way they can. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave lives for our state! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! But also our partners in the world. Today my appeal is broader than usual. And this address is dedicated to the subject on which we will work together in the near future. Namely, compensation for all the losses that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine through its aggression. Please take a look at how this day has passed. Missile strike of the Russian army at the Kharkiv region. In the town of Lozova, the occupiers destroyed a house of culture. Of course, Russia has already done everything possible to ensure that there is no place left for culture on its territory. But what does our Kharkiv region have to do with it? Let them undermine what is left of their houses of culture in Russia, if they want to. The invaders also hit the Odesa region, Poltava region, Zhytomyr region. Attempts to attack Donbas continue. They completely ruined Rubizhne, Volnovakha, just as Mariupol. They are trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities. They do everything to erode any normal life in the Kherson region, in those areas of the Zaporizhzhia region where they entered. All this and much more that the Russian army has done since February 24 and since 2014 needs a fair response. First of all, liberation. We must fight until we clear our land of the occupiers and guarantee Ukraine's security. Secondly, it is the prosecution of all Russian war criminals. In the Ukrainian courts, in the international tribunal and just on the battlefield while the war continues. But, thirdly, we are working to ensure that Russia compensates in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise. Every shut down business, every hryvnia lost by people, enterprises, communities and the state. Russian money as compensation should reach every affected person, family, business. Of course, the Russian state will not even recognize that it is an aggressor. But its recognition is not required. We urge our partner countries to legally recognize that Russia must be held financially responsible for the crimes it committed. This is important not only in the context of this war waged by Russia. But also in the context of any other aggressive actions, whether by Russia or any other potential aggressor. Evil must get a retribution and know that it will be punished. Therefore, we invite the partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism through which each and every one who has suffered from Russia's actions will be able to receive compensation for all losses. Under such an agreement, Russian funds and property under the jurisdiction of partner countries must be seized or frozen, and then confiscated and directed to a specially created fund from which all victims of Russian aggression can receive appropriate compensation. That would be fair. And Russia will feel the true weight of every missile, every bomb, every projectile it has fired at us. We invite our partners to become the founders of such a fund, as well as members of a special international commission that will consider lawsuits, i.e. appeals from both individuals and legal entities. It is clear that this task will not be easy. But in fact, the debate has begun about the need for such compensation at the cost of Russian assets. The world is already talking about it. So we have to do it. And we are starting such a special dialogue with our partners. To make the aggressor feel that the war is capable of inflicting maximum damage not on anyone else, but on the one who went with it to a neighbor. The world has seen that existing international organizations and instruments cannot cope with all the challenges. Therefore, it is necessary not only to use the opportunities that already exist, but also to offer new ones. It will be effective. I also spoke today about Russia's responsibility for this war with representatives of Ireland who visited Ukraine. The Chairpersons of both Houses of the Irish Parliament were in the capital. We had very meaningful talks with them. And one more thing. Today I definitely want to thank our people who do not stop fighting the occupation. And especially those who are now in the territory that is temporarily under the control of Russia, its army. In particular, the rescuers in Enerhodar who protested today deserve support from all of us. Thank you. Each and every one must show that the occupiers have no right to decide anything on our land. This is an important component of our victory. Another decree on awarding our defenders was signed today. 202 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. In total, during the full-scale war, more than 14,000 of our defenders have already been awarded for bravery and efficiency in defending the country and helping our people. Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine! And definitely the last one. Today is three years since I became President of Ukraine. Thank you for your trust. I am proud to be the President. Love you! I will not let you down! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! All our defenders! Today, the 85th day of our defense, will be remembered for sure. I am grateful to the United States for approving a new $ 40 billion package of support for Ukraine and democracy in our region. Today, this package was passed by the US Senate. It is a manifestation of strong leadership and a necessary contribution to our common defense of freedom. A meeting of finance ministers, heads of G7 central banks and representatives of international donors also took place in Germany. I always say frankly: the monthly budget deficit in Ukraine now is $ 5 billion. And to endure the war for freedom, we need quick and sufficient financial support. And it's not just expenditures or a gift from partners. This is their contribution to their own security. Because the defense of Ukraine also means their defense from new wars and crises that Russia may provoke. If it succeeds in the war against Ukraine. That is why we must all work together to ensure that there is no success for Russia in its aggression against our state. Neither military, nor economic, nor any other. I spoke today with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. I personally thanked her for the macro-financial assistance in the amount of 9 billion euros, this package was proposed the day before. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On economic issues, in particular on the export of our agricultural products and fuel imports. And also about the situation in the areas of hostilities and the evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. I am doing my best to keep the most influential international forces informed and, as much as possible, involved in rescuing our military. I addressed students of Ukrainian universities. And it was a special address. I hope it will be heard not only by students. Because now is the time when we have the opportunity to build the future for Ukraine that we really want. Our future, Ukrainian future. Without any obsolete and toxic things that have nothing to do with our national needs and our character. Ukraine has become the master of its own life and must decide for itself how to live. In total, students of 25 Ukrainian universities took part in today's meeting. Geography is quite wide: Kyiv, Bila Tserkva, Mariupol, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lviv, Kryvyi Rih, Donetsk, Kherson, Ivano-Frankivsk, Horlivka, Dnipro. Not all universities operate in their cities. Some of them moved. But what was nice and right - students and rectors are confident that Ukraine will win and restore free life throughout the territory. Important current issues were also discussed. Firstly, I instructed the Minister of Education to prepare changes that will allow applicants from all temporarily occupied territories to enter Ukrainian universities under a simplified procedure. Secondly, I instructed the Minister to decide how to ensure the education of those students who study under contract, but come from the currently occupied territories. Obviously, it is extremely difficult to pay for a contract to study in such conditions. The state must help. Therefore, I expect relevant decisions from the Minister, the Government and, if necessary, the people's deputies. We talked with students about post-war reconstruction and how to guarantee the security of our state for decades to come. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue the liberation of the Kharkiv region. But in Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure. There's hell, and that's not an exaggeration. The brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk... 12 dead and dozens wounded in just one day. The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army - all this is not just hostilities during the war. Russian strikes at the Chernihiv region, in particular the terrible strike at Desna, debris clearance continues, many dead; constant strikes at the Odesa region, at the cities of central Ukraine, Donbas is completely destroyed - all this doesn’t and cannot have any military explanation for Russia. This is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible. Destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible. This is what will be qualified as the genocide of the Ukrainian people and for which the occupiers will definitely be brought to justice. The first trial in Ukraine against a Russian war criminal has already begun. And it will end with the full restoration of justice within the international tribunal. I'm sure of it. We will find and bring to justice all those who give and carry out criminal orders. Today I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 210 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 48 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was posthumously awarded to Captain Serhiy Parkhomenko, commander of the aviation unit of the 299th tactical aviation brigade. Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to everyone who is fighting for independence! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"I am really glad to have the opportunity to talk to you today and I hope that this will be exactly communication. Not a lecture or seminar, which I'm sure you already have enough. I would like to build a dialogue with you, so in my speech I will ask questions, and I am interested to hear each and everyone who would like to answer.  So when you ask your questions, please choose one or several of my questions and give your answer. Let's start. This is a very special time for our country. Millions of our people are now fighting for the right to life and freedom for our people. And it really opens up a space of possibilities. Right now it is our country that is in a situation where we can choose the future for it as we decide. That is, it is not just an adaptation to the conditions created for Ukraine by other generations or even other states. As it is for other countries, and as it was for our state before the war. We can consciously reshape our lives. Here is what is possible now. These are great opportunities, this is the time to determine which Ukraine you want to live in. So my first question to you today is about this: what should our state be like? And this question logically continues with a number of related questions. Do you want to live in Ukraine? Do you expect changes from Ukraine to live here? Or, on the contrary, you believe that our country already has everything for you to live here. Let's move on. There are many countries in the world that are talking about reforms. Even the most developed ones always have it. The words ""the system is not working and needs to be fixed."" This is a common narrative for many politicians. But in few countries, as in ours now, there are opportunities not just to ""fix"" the existing system, but to create a new one. Based on what is best. Not only here, now. But also in those countries where it would be worth taking the best. Of course, this war put an end to many things from the life of Ukraine before. But not to all. For example, our people who have gone abroad while the hostilities are going on say that certain things in our lives are much more progressive than in other countries. Digitization, which we started doing in the public sphere. Internet and communication, which are very accessible due to business. The service sector, in which speed and willingness to work is often greater than in many European countries. It turned out so. We must also not forget that even during a full-scale war, our institutions did not break down. Banking sphere works. The budget system and public administration have endured. Defense and logistics are ensured despite the fact that the enemy in some respects has more forces and equipment. That is, society has a certain foundation, and it would be unwise not to use it. But we must understand that Russia will always be there. And it may always be a threat. After February 24, we have already achieved a lot. And now, for example, you can see how the world evaluates our potential in a fundamentally different way. Perhaps you have seen how two Forbes articles are compared, very interestingly: the headline of February 12 - will Russia invade Ukraine; and the headline of May 16 - will Ukraine’s army invade Russia. That is, the world began to look differently at the situation in our region and the balance of power. But it is important what we think about ourselves. What our people feel about our state. So, my next question to you: what should Ukraine be like so that you can be sure that we can protect ourselves from any threat? This question also continues with a number of others. For example, a professional contract army or with the addition of a certain form of conscription? How big should the army be? What share of public expenditures should we spend on defense? The biggest or not? And even in the conditions of the future peace? Should private military companies be allowed? Should there be a universal military obligation in Ukraine for all boys and girls, as is the case, for example, in Israel, so that all our people can defend themselves when needed? And should all citizens or a significant part, as is the case in other states, be involved in military training every year? Suppose, while maintaining the salary and job at the time of the training. Are you ready to personally defend Ukraine with weapons in hands? Or do you think it is fair that someone else will fight on the battlefield? These questions of mine are not rhetorical. We really need answers. And it's not just something purely functional. About state governance or politics. It's about how our people can understand each other and how to stay in Ukraine, because this is our home. Your home. How not to quarrel in it and live developing common interests. For example, people often remain in the rear, but demand from those on the frontline to drive the occupiers all the way to Kuban. It is often the case that a person in the military sphere does not go beyond photographs in camouflage, but at the same time behaves as if he can lead the troops better than anyone else. What is your attitude to such people, for example, in politics? Or in the media? Anyone, it doesn't matter. And how should their personal emotions and ambitions relate to reality, to real war? Does a non-combatant have the right to demand something from warriors? Demand meeting some of your requirements and expectations? Is that fair? You probably see that this war can end for Ukraine with certain security guarantees. And in this regard, I have the following question for you: Which countries do you see among the possible guarantors of security for Ukraine? Should we choose those we trust? Or should we focus on everyone who is strong enough? Security guarantees for Ukraine are a really good opportunity to create a tool for decades that will allow us to live in peace. Although it will not allow us to be careless about security. All the same, we will always think about defense. And we must understand that there is no better security than the willingness of citizens to defend their own state. Because it is the protection of oneself first of all - one's family, one's home, one's land, one's way of life. This is the state - all this. So, if any of you are not personally ready to defend the state - well, tell me why? Perhaps you see your other contribution to the common national security, which is really special? Maybe it's something in the field of cybersecurity. You may want to join some form of volunteering. Perhaps, as future businessmen or scientists - you see for yourself some other option, the third, fourth, fifth.   So, my next question to you: Should the state regulate at its discretion who to involve in defense and how, or leave people the choice during the war? Of course, I have my answers to these questions. But Ukraine differs from Russia and other tyrannies with the fact that not one person decides everything for the whole nation, but people can choose the rules of life for themselves. So, the next block of questions. Given that Russia will remain our neighbor, we need to consider the format of security inside Ukraine. The key question is about weapons. Is there a need for the order of possession of firearms by ordinary people that, say, we see in the United States? Or, as in Switzerland, in a society of ""citizens with weapons"" who can quickly join the defense of their country, and where, for example, a former soldier can keep at home the weapons with which he served. What should be the weapons system? Should it be allowed to carry it openly? Should it be limited to the right to own and keep it at home? Should the rules be the same for all regions of the country or should more liberal ones be provided for those regions where there is a greater threat of invasion? Do you know how to use weapons? How should the border with Russia work after this war? Should it be completely closed or open? In other words, how do you see coexistence with the Russian Federation and its citizens after the war? Could there be what they call the word ""relationship"" between us and them? Or should it be deliberately restricted, even if it occurs at some level? Let's move on. It’s been a long time since I was a student and that's understandable. And I think more about which universities my children will study at. Which Ukrainian universities. This is very important. Maybe my daughter, who will soon be 18, will be in an auditorium one of you is currently studying in. But I remember well when I was a student. And I remember that many people of my generation felt a certain loss of time. Years in auditoria, years of lectures... It seemed to many and, I'm sure, now someone thinks for sure that 5 or 6 years at university is a long time. Probably, if it is a medical specialty, it takes 7 years and a lifetime to study, taking into account all the nuances. But if it is some other specialty, does it always take 5 years? Perhaps 2, 3, 4 are enough for some, given how the modern economy works and how quickly technology is transformed. What do you think about it? And what economic life are you preparing for? Do you anticipate that you will have to change professions during your life? Several times. Or what professions, in your opinion, will always exist and will not be replaced by artificial intelligence and robotics? Maybe it is worth increasing the share of private business in the education system? What do you think about private universities, what do you think about private schools, private education? Can your university's curriculum compete with the curricula and courses currently offered in a variety of formats outside of universities? Don't you feel like you're wasting your time? Because now in the world, even more than before, the main thing is speed. There is such a feeling. Speed in the ability to learn. In everything. At work, in the constant transformation that life demands of the individual. Modern life. I must have been talking for a long time already. Then the last question. Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine has been going on for three months already. After 8 years of war in Donbas. This war for us now is undoubtedly a war for independence. We can say that this is a postponed war. Postponed for 30 years, given how we gained independence in 1991. Or for hundreds of years, given the previous history of our great state. I have no doubt that we will gain independence. And it will be in our history the same as in other countries that fought for independence and won. Countries that ceased to be beggars and became subjects. The real masters of their lives and their future. But we must remember now and always that the price of all this is tens of thousands of lives. The lives of all those killed by the enemy. Tens of thousands. For independence. And for the opportunity for each of you to choose how to live and which Ukraine to live in. So, my question to you: Is it worth it? I really hope to hear the answer to this question.

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, one of the representatives of the Russian state said that the occupiers allegedly began to use laser weapons systems in Ukraine. Allegedly to save missiles. Firstly, it is noteworthy that they need to save missiles and somehow explain it. That is, more than two thousand missiles fired by the Russian army at Ukraine were the main part of their stockpile of missiles. That is, only the remnants are left. Secondly, everyone has already seen Russia at war. Inexperienced conscripts, which it throws into battle like cannon fodder. Marauders who see normal appliances for the first time in a foreign country. Old Soviet ""armor"" without modern protection. Forbidden phosphorous bombs, which they use to burn schools and ordinary houses. And missiles, most of which were spent by the Russian army on the destruction of absolutely civilian infrastructure without any strategic military outcome. Today they hit missiles in such a way at Mykolaiv and Dnipro. Well, in the propaganda of Nazi Germany there was such a term ""wunderwaffe"". Wonder weapon. The clearer it became they had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about the wonder weapon, which would be so powerful that it would provide a turning point in the war. And here we see that in the third month of a full-scale war, Russia is trying to find its ""wunderwaffe"". Allegedly laser. All this clearly indicates the complete failure of the invasion. But again, this also shows that they are afraid to admit that catastrophic mistakes have been made at the highest state and military levels in Russia. Therefore, they will come up with more and more ""wunderwaffe"" as the Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our defenders liberate our land step by step. How long will it take? The answer to this question can only be given by the real situation on the battlefield. We are trying to do it as soon as possible. That's for sure. We are obliged to drive out the occupiers and guarantee Ukraine real security. That is why I signed decrees on the extension of the legal regime of martial law and the term of general mobilization. I hope that the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine will support this decision in the near future. Our army and all those who defend the state must have all the legal tools to act steadily. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all of our cities and communities that are under occupation - under temporary occupation - should know that Ukraine will return. I said today in my address on the occasion of the Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Deportation of the Crimean Tatar People that our state does not leave anyone behind and returns what belongs to Ukraine by right. We remember Crimea. And we will never forget 1944 - the genocide of Crimean Tatars committed by the Soviet authorities. And 2014 - the second wave of destruction of everything free on the Crimean peninsula. Especially on this day I signed the law on the protection of persons deprived of liberty by the occupiers, as well as on the protection of family members of such people. We are talking about all the Kremlin prisoners - both in Crimea and in the occupied part of Donbas. The law gives them more protection and assistance from the state. We are also accumulating all possible resources of the world to support Ukraine. I am grateful to Andriy Shevchenko, our legendary football player, for becoming the first ambassador of the new national brand of Ukraine - United24. The state needs this platform right now, which allows, in particular, to raise funds to support Ukraine. Anyone in the world - in one click - can contribute to our victory. And in the direction he or she considers most important. For example, defense and demining, medical care or rebuilding the country. And in early June we will be able to see the first special event in London with the participation of Andriy Shevchenko in support of United24. I thanked President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for the package of aid to our country announced today. Its amount is 9 billion euros. And also for supporting the plans for restoration of Ukraine. This step by the European Commission is a testament to the true leadership that the European Union is capable of. And it will definitely help us in the struggle for our common freedom. I spoke with the new President of the United Arab Emirates. Congratulated him on his election and invited to take part in the post-war reconstruction of the state. We discussed the threat to global food security that Russia had provoked by the invasion. And traditionally in the evening I signed the decree on awarding our heroes. 197 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 5 of them - posthumously. Also today I had the honor to present the Order of the Golden Star to servicemen who were previously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. In particular, to Colonel Serhiy Baranovsky for courage and efficiency in the battles in Donbas. And to Colonel Serhiy Musienko for personal courage and success in the battles in the Kharkiv region.

0,"Dear citizens! All our great people! On this day last year, I said we would be back. Return to Crimea. Every year on May 18, Ukraine commemorates the victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar people. The people whom they wanted to deprive of their homeland. The people whom they wanted to deprive of their lives. The people whose history and whose name they wanted to erase. But the people who managed to return home. Managed to preserve themselves and the truth. On May 18, 1944, the Soviet authorities began the forced deportation of the indigenous people of Crimea, the Crimean Tatars, from their only homeland. After the terrible war that took place in Crimea, as well as throughout Ukraine, as well as throughout Europe, the whole people was then put on the brink of survival. During and after the deportation, when the Crimean Tatar people were forced to live abroad, almost half of the IDPs died. Almost half the people! It was a deliberate crime of tyranny against the people and against humanity as such. Today we turn again to what was experienced then. And we are doing this in conditions when the descendants of that tyranny are not only trying to deprive Crimean Tatars of their home for the second time - since 2014. They also want to take away the home of the entire multi-million Ukrainian people - all who live on our land. Significant territories are under the occupation of the Russian army. There are so-called filtration camps, through which hundreds of thousands of people pass. The occupiers are destroying our cities, our villages. They forced more than 12 million Ukrainian men and women to leave their home. And again, like 78 years ago, they are forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of our people abroad to remote areas. Last year, on May 18, addressing the people, I recalled the lines of the Crimean Tatar poetess Lilya Budzhurova ""When we return"": When all our people return home / You will have to remember where we were born / You will have to remember where you yourself were born / Showed up as uninvited guests here. And this year, in the days of this war, we prove: Ukraine is really coming back. The truth is coming back. And people are coming back. A full-scale invasion of Russia, inspired by the worst the world has seen in the 1940s, raises from ashes the experience of that time. However, it encourages us to return these occupiers to what all anti-human regimes ultimately go through, namely, their defeat. The territory of the northern regions of our state has already been liberated. We are returning the Kharkiv region. Defenders of our state are repelling the most desperate efforts of the occupiers in Donbas. The Armed Forces of Ukraine simultaneously repel the attacks of Russian troops in the south. We defend Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Odesa. And we remember every city and every community that is still under occupation. I always emphasize: under temporary occupation. And, of course, we remember Crimea. The occupying forces have already suffered such defeats in Ukraine that Russia has not seen in various wars for decades. Poisoned by state propaganda, many Russians are simply unaware of this yet. They do not want to see how big their losses are - in different senses of the word. People, economy, culture, future. But life will make them feel these losses. In 1944, expelling the Crimean Tatars from their land, the then torturers were convinced that none of the displaced would return home, to Crimea. Now, trying to occupy Ukraine and destroy our lives, the current torturers of the people were also convinced that everything would work out for them and that we would not be able to endure it. And we endured. And we are struggling to bring life back to every corner of our home. And we are coming back. Today, on this very day, I am signing the law ""On Social and Legal Protection of Persons Deprived of Personal Freedom as a Result of Armed Aggression against Ukraine and Members of Their Families"" adopted by the Verkhovna Rada. This law is to protect all those ordinary peaceful, civilian people who have been repressed by the occupiers and who have been taken prisoner by them. This law is, in particular, for Nariman Dzhelyalov and many others who are deprived of their liberty by strangers in Crimea, in their native home. For those who are being held in prisons on the peninsula and who have been deported to Russia. This law is for the relatives and friends of all prisoners of the Kremlin - in Donetsk, Luhansk, in all those areas, and in Crimea. For all who have been tormented by the enemy. This is help and protection. And we will definitely restore justice. Qırım serbest olacaq! Eternal memory to all victims of the genocide of the Crimean Tatar people!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 83rd day of our defense began with a rather powerful combination of Russian strikes at Ukraine. Missile shelling of the Lviv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region. Air strikes in the Luhansk region. Specific sabotage activity in the border areas of Ukraine. All this is not just creating tension for our state, not just testing our strength. This is a kind of attempt of the Russian army to compensate for a series of failures in the east and south of our country. They cannot demonstrate success with general military action in the areas where they are trying to advance. So they are trying to show success through their missiles and other activities. To no avail as well. These strikes, like many previous ones, do not change anything radically. Especially since our air defense and anti-sabotage measures are becoming stronger. I had a conversation today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Quite productive. First of all, about the defense support for Ukraine, about our cooperation at the EU level. I informed him about the current situation on the battlefield and the possible development of this situation. I had a conversation with President of France Emmanuel Macron. Substantive and long. We discussed the sixth package of sanctions being prepared in the European Union. We also discussed the negotiation process with Russia and evacuation of our heroes from Azovstal. The evacuation mission continues, it is overseen by our military and intelligence. The most influential international mediators are involved. We also spoke separately and substantively with the President of France about our European integration steps and the consideration of Ukraine's application for EU candidate status. I continue to gather the largest possible international audience for Ukraine. To support our state at all levels. And to put pressure on Russia at all levels. Information, diplomatic and cultural pressure is what we need. So that, as in the days of World War II, the struggle for freedom can rely in particular on the power of art. So today, during the opening ceremony of the Cannes Film Festival, I addressed the world filmmaking community. I reminded that now, as in the 1940s, it is necessary to boldly and openly defend freedom and fight the dictatorship. Right now is the time. When the language of cinematography can and should become the language of the struggle for freedom. Today I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 165 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 13 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 3 servicemen of the 24th separate mechanized brigade. To those who showed extraordinary courage and efficiency in the battles in Donbas. Today I bid farewell to the first President of Ukraine Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk. The ceremony took place in Kyiv. In Kyiv, which will remain Ukrainian. The capital of an independent state. From 1991 and forever. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who fought for independence! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"It is a great honor for me to address you. Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends! I will tell you a story. Indeed, a lot of stories begin with the words ""I will tell you a story"". But in this one, the finale will be much more important than the beginning. And this will not be an open ending. Finally, it can put an end to a battle that has lasted more than a hundred years. This battle began with the arrival of the train. The hero and the antagonist came out of it. And so the confrontation on the screen was born, which turned into real life. First, cinematography appeared in our life, then it became our life. And then, what the future would be like depended on cinematography as well. My story today is about this battle. About the battle. And about the future. The worst dictators of the 20th century loved cinematography. It is known about them. But the most important thing left after them is the eerie documentary footage of the newsreel. As well as movies that challenged these dictators. The first festival was to begin on September 1, 1939 in Cannes. But World War II broke out. For six years, cinematography has been on the frontlines of this war, along with all mankind. For six years, cinematography has been fighting for freedom, and also, unfortunately, for the benefit of the dictatorship. Now, going back to that movie, we can see how freedom was moving towards victory. And in the end, it did not allow dictators to capture people's hearts. There were many important points along the way. However, the most outstanding was in 1940. When, in contrast to the antagonist, the world saw, at first glance, an inconspicuous guy who did not look like a hero at all. But he turned out to be so. ""The Great Dictator"" by Charlie Chaplin did not destroy the real dictator then. But thanks to it, cinematography ceased to be dumb. Dumb in every sense of the word. Cinematography spoke, and it was the voice of the future victory of freedom. Even then, in 1940. When the screens sounded: “The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…” Since then - since those words of the hero played by Chaplin - mankind has produced many beautiful movies. It seemed that everyone already understood that one can conquer people with the beautiful, gathering them near the screens, and not with the ugly, gathering them in bomb shelters. It seemed that everyone already believed that the horror in the form of a full-scale war that could cover the entire continent would not have continuation. But again, as then, there is a dictator. Again, as then, there is a war for freedom. Again, as then, it is necessary for cinematography not to be dumb. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. Planning to go further to Europe. And what kind of war is this? I want to answer this question as clearly as possible. Armed with the words that were said by cinematography in the years after the previous continental war.   You have already heard most of these words. They sound eerie. On the screen. But, unfortunately, this has become a reality. Remember that? Remember how it sounded in the movies? “You smell that? Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning…” Yes, it started in Ukraine in the morning. At four o'clock, when we heard the first missile explosions. When the air strikes began. And when death, going to Ukraine across the border, marked its equipment with the swastika analogue - the ""Z"" symbol. ""They all want to be better Nazis than Hitler..."" Now, there is not a single week passing without mass graves of killed and tortured people found in the territory where Russian troops were or still are. 229 children were killed as a result of the Russian invasion. “They can't get anywhere but kill, kill, kill! They have sown Europe with corpses…” You saw what the Russian military did in the small town of Bucha. You saw Mariupol. Saw Azovstal. Saw the theater blown up by a Russian bomb. By the way, it was similar to where you are now. Ordinary civilians were hiding there from the shelling. Two large and noticeable inscriptions ""Children"". They were on the asphalt near the theater. And we will never forget it, because it is not even Hell. “War isn't Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse…” More than 2,000 Russian missiles have already hit Ukraine. Dozens of cities were completely destroyed. Scorched villages. More than 500,000 Ukrainians have been deported to Russia by force. Tens of thousands are in Russian camps created on the model of Nazi camps. No one knows how many prisoners will survive there. But everyone knows who is to blame. “You think soap can wash you?” Unlikely. The worst war since World War II is already in Europe. First of all, because of one person who is in Moscow. Other people die every day. And they will not come to life after the phrase ""Stop, cut!"". But what do we hear about it now? Will the movie be silent or will it speak? If there is a dictator, if there is a war for freedom and if again, as then, everything depends on our unity, will cinematography remain outside this unity? Our cities are not destroyed by virtual graphics. Many Ukrainians have become Guido and are trying to explain to children why they have to hide in the basement. Many Ukrainians have become like Aldo Raine. The land of our country is already streaked with thousands of trenches. Of course, we will continue to fight. And we have no alternative but to fight for freedom. And I am sure that the dictator will lose. But words should sound like in 1940. Sound from all screens of the free world. We need a new Chaplin, who will prove again that cinematography is no longer dumb. Remember how it sounded then: “Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness… To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair… The hate of men will pass, and dictators die.” We must finally win this battle. And we need cinematography that will provide just such a finale. So that every voice is on the side of freedom. And, as it has always been seen, first of all the voice of cinematography. I thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 82nd day of our defense is coming to an end. A difficult day. But this day, like all others, is aimed precisely at saving our country and our people. Regarding the situation in Mariupol. Thanks to the actions of the Ukrainian military - the Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence, the negotiating team, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations, we hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys. Among them are the seriously wounded, they are being provided with medical aid. I want to emphasize: Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle. I think that every adequate person will understand these words. The operation to rescue the defenders of Mariupol was started by our military and intelligence officers. To bring the boys home, the work continues, and this work needs delicacy. And time. We also maintain maximum diplomatic activity in other areas in the interests of Ukraine. I spoke today with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. On how to speed up the provision of financial assistance to Ukraine, given the state budget deficit during the war, which is about $ 5 billion a month. We also talked about the main directions of further cooperation. On the eve of the meeting of the G7 finance ministers, these talks with the IMF Managing Director are a direct preparation for very important decisions for Ukraine. A high-ranking Polish delegation worked in Kyiv. Consultations with them were held regarding cooperation at the European Union level. In particular, it concerns the acceleration of our integration into the European Union and the expected decision on the candidate status for Ukraine. We are also working to ensure that the European Union agrees on a sixth package of sanctions on Russia. The oil embargo must be a part of it, and it is in the interests not only of our state, but also of the whole of Europe. I am grateful to those leaders of the continent who are aware of this and help promote the respective decision. I addressed the student community of the United States of America - representatives of leading universities. I also talked to the rectors and presidents of these educational institutions. The key issue is to involve American universities in rebuilding our education system after the war. In addition, we discussed political issues, including the protection of democracy, countering Russian propaganda and fakes. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are repelling constant attacks in those areas where Russia is still trying to advance. Severodonetsk and other cities in Donbas remain the main targets for the occupiers. We do everything to protect our land and our people. I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 201 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Senior Lieutenant Ahasyiev Kyrylo Yashar oğlu - platoon commander of the 92nd separate mechanized brigade. And posthumously to Lieutenant Colonel Yerk Vyacheslav Volodymyrovych, commander of the aviation squadron of the 40th tactical aviation brigade. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity, I am grateful for the honor to address the students today, to answer your questions. Not all of you, however, look like students. You are already rectors, already heads of educational institutions, presidents. But as far as I understand, the student community hears us and it is very important that it sees us. This is really important. Because my speech is dedicated to them and then I will be ready for a dialogue. To them exactly, because the speech is about choice. This is the age when you have to make a choice. The main choice that everyone makes in one way or another in his life. Makes at this, I would say, golden age, student age. Or even earlier. When choosing the answer to the question of who he is. Who are you? What are you like? I will give you my example so that you can feel what I am talking about and what I wanted to tell you. Who am I? I am the President of Ukraine. I studied law. Then practiced in court. Then I became an artist, producer, businessman. And then I became a President - the President of our beautiful state. And each of these stages was supposedly a different life. But in fact, it's one life. This is the answer to the question of who you are in life. Are you a subject or are you just watching? Are you trying to change something or not? Are you worried - and that's all, or are you worried and trying to help, fix, do something? It is a choice that determines life. What you will be. What your country will be like. Each of you, students, even if you don't realize it, makes that choice. Every day. And then it becomes your character, it becomes your destiny. For example, each and every one of you in life has probably been in a situation where there is hatred next to you. When a person insults another person in word or deed. When another person is humiliated. When someone is trying to take something from another person. Are there many who will help in this situation? There are those who just watch. Someone will shoot a video with a smartphone, it is very popular now, and then post it on Instagram or YouTube. Someone may just laugh. And someone will still help. Stop the humiliation. Stop the hatred. Help a person feel dignity again. There are many situations when the word can mean salvation for a person. Who feels that life is not going in the right direction. Or when a mistake is made. Seemingly a terrible and fatal mistake. After which you may not want to live at all. We have all seen such situations in the movies. When a person may attempt suicide. And some have seen it in real life. And some have faced a choice - whether to try to help or not? Or just to walk by? Whether to shoot a video of what you see and then collect likes and shares on your social network? It is good that there are people who do not stay away. Those who take the situation into their own hands and help. I remember a terrible day for your nation and for the whole democratic world - 9/11. I then watched the attack on the ""twins"" on TV - with my friends. And some of them just couldn't believe what was happening. Some even said that this could only happen in America. And he was told very quickly that it could happen in any country, it could happen to anyone. Because terror knows no borders. I remembered how shortly before September 11 I was in New York, I was there - in the ""twins"". And I felt that it could happen when I was there. That I could be among thousands of people - either in the towers or next to them. And I would be faced with the same choice - how to escape? How to save others? Who to help? And could I be able to help myself? When one day you decide for yourself that you have to be the master of your life, then you always stay with that power and look for what to do. After the full-scale invasion of Russia, I heard a lot of advice. All of them came down to the fact that we have to accept that Ukraine has become a victim. Victim of the occupation of Russia. That there is almost no chance for resistance. That the Russian army will allegedly take down all our resistance very quickly - three or five days. And that it is supposedly better for me to just leave Ukraine, because no one will be able to stop Russia. I was offered help with transport instead of help with weapons! But it was just not about us. These were completely wrong proposals. They did not take into account who we are. Who I am. How we see life here in Ukraine. Our country will never be a victim again. It will not just be an observer of life - including its own life. We can, want to and will be subjects in life. We made this choice. This is my choice. And the choice of the vast majority of Ukrainian citizens. This is where our strength comes from, our strong desire for the freedom we are fighting for. And I am grateful to those who made that choice with us. Who also decided to be the subject of life and the struggle for principles, and they are the same for us - the struggle for freedom. There is case law in your country. If once - even a long time ago - a decision was made at the appropriate level by a proper court, similar cases are decided according to this precedent. This is always taken into account. The same is true, in fact, in international politics. What is Russia doing now? It is trying to set a precedent. If it manages to break the statehood of the neighboring nation, other states will do the same. What is Ukraine doing now with its partners? Trying to set another precedent. So that all the aggressors in the world once and for all see that the war will create the biggest problems for them - for the aggressors. So that they know that the hatred they spread against ordinary people like you and me, against other nations, will strike first and foremost at themselves when the free world refuses to deal with those who spread such hatred. This is a very transparent process of struggle. And everyone chooses a role in it. There are states that are trying to stay away. Be supposedly neutral. And not help fight for our common values. It's the same as in life, when help is needed, and there is only a crowd of people watching instead of helping. And there are states that contribute as much as possible to protect freedom. To stop the aggression. To guarantee the force of international law. It is this role that the United States has chosen, and I am very grateful to your people, to your leaders for that choice. After all, it is also the answer to who you want to be in life. Those who do not want to be just a victim or an indifferent observer. But those who can and do defend democracy, because that is how they protect themselves as well. Their freedom, their way of life, their people. Their worldview in which there should be no room for individual violence or brutal wars. Each of you right now - at this age and in the position you are in - chooses this for yourself. How do you respond to challenges? What do you do when you see injustice? And I really want you to choose this path for yourself. The path of clear awareness of who you are. The path of agency. Because if it is your choice, it will always be the choice of your country. Just as it is the choice of our country. Thank you very much! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! The 81st day of our defense is coming to an end and another week of round-the-clock work for Ukraine and victory is beginning. This week, as always, there will be a lot of international activity in which I will take part. The key is weapons and financial support for Ukraine. Finances not only to maintain stability now, but also to begin rebuilding what Russia has ruined. We are also working to strengthen sanctions on Russia. Partners need to make decisions that limit Russia's ties to the world every week. The occupiers must feel the rising cost of war for them, feel it constantly. Now the priority is the oil embargo. No matter how hard Moscow tries to disrupt this decision, the time of Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources is coming to an end. And that can’t be changed. Another task, which becomes even more important the longer the war lasts, is to do everything to maintain the world's maximum attention to us, to Ukraine. Information about our needs should be in the news of all countries that are important to us constantly and every day. In particular, for this purpose - for greater information and political support of Ukraine - on Monday I will communicate with students of leading American universities. These are 63 US universities and two Canadian universities, which unite hundreds of thousands of students and are a large expert and research community. Their voice will definitely strengthen our capabilities. A separate address to Stanford University students is also planned for the end of May. I am also preparing to communicate with Ukrainian students from the leading universities of our country. In my address to them I will answer some important difficult questions that already exist in our society, which are already visible. And I expect profound questions from them, from our students. I will definitely continue to address the parliaments of Ukraine's European partner states. Our task is the status of a candidate for EU membership for Ukraine, and later - accession to the European Union under the fast-track procedure. Every state matters. Every vote counts. It is equally important to have the maximum consent of European countries in the issue of strengthening sanctions on Russia. That is why I will be addressing the Luxembourg Parliament in the near future. By the way, we are also working to expand the geography of such special speeches in the parliaments of Africa and Asia. An address to the participants of the Davos Forum is scheduled for May 23. This year the conference will be especially important for our country. Post-war reconstruction will be discussed. We are doing our best to fully gather the support of the world, and participation in the Davos Forum is one of the best opportunities for that. We continue very complicated and delicate negotiations to save our people from Mariupol, from Azovstal. We deal with this issue on a daily basis. And the main thing is for the agreements to be fulfilled. We expect the United States to adopt important decisions for our country. A new significant package of support and detailed elaboration of the renewed historical program of the Lend-Lease. We are preparing for new attempts by Russia to attack in Donbas, to somehow intensify its movement in the south of Ukraine. The occupiers still do not want to admit that they are in a dead end and their so-called ""special operation"" has already gone bankrupt. But the moment will surely come when the Ukrainian people will force the invaders to fully recognize reality. No matter how ""creative"" they are in Kherson and Melitopol, no matter how they portray their alleged ""power"" in the occupied areas of Pryazovia and Donbas, they are there temporarily. The Ukrainian flag, Ukrainian law, Ukrainian life will still be there anyway. Today's Russian missile strikes at the Lviv region, shelling of Hulyaipole, Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, cities and communities of the Donetsk region - all this brutality of the occupiers, which Ukraine is experiencing every day, will only lead to the fact that Russian surviving soldiers will bring this evil back to Russia. They will bring it back because they will retreat. This is how all the feverish activity of the Russian military we see now will end. And I am grateful to all the Ukrainians who are bringing this time closer. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Wise people of our bravest country! All our defenders! Last year, on May 14, the Day of Remembrance of Ukrainians who saved Jews during World War II was celebrated in our country for the first time. 2659 Ukrainian men and women received the title of Righteous Among the Nations. Our country is the fourth in the world in the number of the Righteous. People who risked their lives, the lives of their loved ones, but still saved those who were threatened with imminent death at the hands of the Nazis. Rescued children, adults, whole families. Each of these rescue stories is impressive. It strikes with courage, because there was total evil around, and people still kept good in their hearts. It strikes with belief that humanity will still win despite the then occupation and the power of the Nazis. The Righteous were in all regions of our state - from Zakarpattia to Crimea, from Odesa to Kharkiv. And we do not know all the stories of salvation. There were many who simply did not have time to tell thanks to whom their life was saved. They also rescued very young children who simply could not understand what was really happening to them. We must always remember that our people have such Righteous among them and that even in the darkest circumstances there are people who carry light. This is exactly the same striving for good that we see today in Ukrainian men and women who help save people from the occupiers, from the same Nazis. I am grateful to all journalists and just all caring people who document modern stories of salvation and record for all generations of our people what Ukraine has to go through and how people show their best qualities saving others - acquaintances and strangers, relatives, children, adults. I held talks today with a delegation of US senators led by Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitchell McConnell in Kyiv. I believe that this visit once again demonstrates the strength of bipartisan support for our state, the strength of ties between the Ukrainian and American nations. We discussed various areas of support for our state, including defensive and financial. As well as tightening sanctions on Russia. I expressed gratitude for the historic decision to renew the Lend Lease program. I called for the official recognition of Russia as a terrorist state. One of the issues I deal with on a daily basis is food security. More and more countries around the world are realizing that Russia, by blocking the Black Sea for us and continuing this war, puts dozens of other countries at risk of a price crisis in the food market and even famine. This is another incentive for our anti-war coalition to act more decisively together. Now support for Ukraine - and especially with weapons - means working to prevent global famine. The sooner we liberate our land and guarantee Ukraine's security, the sooner the normal state of the food market can be restored. The situation in Donbas remains very difficult. Russian troops are still trying to show at least some victory. On the 80th day of the full-scale invasion, it looks especially insane, but they do not stop all these efforts. I am grateful to everyone who holds the line and brings closer to Donbas, Pryazovia and Kherson the same thing that is happening now in the Kharkiv region. Step by step we are forcing the occupiers to leave our land. We will make them leave the Ukrainian sea as well. By the way, now in many cities and communities of Ukraine there are discussions about renaming streets and squares. My advice is to turn to the stories of the Ukrainian Righteous and perpetuate their memory. Because it is about the courage and humanity of Ukrainians who have already proved that the evil that comes to our land will inevitably lose. Eternal glory to all our defenders! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Unbreakable people of our most beautiful country! Our defenders! Today we can report on the 200th downed Russian military aircraft. Russia has not lost so many aircraft in any war in decades. And Russia has lost almost 27,000 soldiers, many of them young conscripts. Russia has lost more than three thousand tanks, armored combat vehicles, a large number of conventional military vehicles, helicopters, drones and all its prospects as a state. And why all this? For a monument to Lenin to stand in the temporarily occupied Henichesk for a little longer? There is no other result for Russia and there will not be any. In fact, no one today can predict how long this war will last. But we are doing everything we can to liberate our land quickly. This is our priority - to work every day to make the war shorter. However, this depends, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already doing the maximum. It also depends on our partners. On European countries, on the countries of the whole free world. I am grateful to all those who are working to strengthen sanctions on Russia and to increase defense and financial support for us, for Ukraine. This is the only recipe for defending freedom in the face of Russia's invasion. And for Western countries, it's not just expenditures. It is not about accounting. It is about the future. The world has already recognized that Russia's blockade of our ports and this war are provoking a large-scale food crisis. Russian officials are also openly threatening the world that there will be famine in dozens of countries. And what could be the consequences of such a famine? What political instability and migration flows will this lead to? How much will you have to spend then to overcome the consequences? These are the questions that need to be answered by those who are delaying sanctions on Russia or trying to postpone aid to Ukraine. Every day of war is an increase in global threats, it is a new opportunity for Russia to provoke instability in other parts of the world, not only here in Europe. And these are new lost lives in Ukraine: Ukrainian men and women who give their lives so that everyone can live freely. I emphasize this: everyone, especially in those countries where they still find time to argue instead of investing in aid as much as possible. Therefore, much more pressure on Russia is needed. And I talk about it openly and daily to everyone on whom it depends. We continue to restore the de-occupied territories of Ukraine. As of today, 1015 settlements have been de-occupied, which is plus six in the past 24 hours. We return electricity, water supply, communications, transport, social services there. It is important. Of course, we remember every city and every community that is still under occupation. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all cities and towns of Donbas... The gradual liberation of the Kharkiv region proves that we will not leave anyone to the enemy. We do not stop trying to save all our people from Mariupol and Azovstal. Currently, very difficult negotiations are underway on the next stage of the evacuation mission - the rescue of the seriously wounded, medics. It is a large number of people. Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate everyone else, each of our defenders. Everyone in the world who can be the most influential mediator has already been involved in the relevant negotiations. Already 37 foreign missions have resumed their work in Kyiv. And I am grateful to all of them, because this is 37 proofs that Ukraine stands strong and has prospects in contrast to the Russian Federation. I am sure that other foreign missions will return to the capital soon. It is worth returning to work for all Ukrainian businesses that have not yet resumed operations, although they may do so in a safe area. Providing jobs and adjusting economic activity to the existing conditions is also a big contribution to defense, to our future.

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! I do not tire of repeating these words, addressing everyone - everyone who defends the state. Today these words sound special. On the International Nurses Day. The professional holiday of tens of thousands of Ukrainian women, as well as Ukrainian paramedic officers who are doing one of the most important things for victory - saving the lives of our soldiers, our civilians. Today I had the honor to present state awards to the representatives of this profession. Those who did not stop working and rescuing people under enemy fire and during the occupation. Tetiana Tarasenko, Alla Chernets and Liudmyla Husak from the Sumy region. Vira Tselyk, Oksana Umanets and Iryna Vernyhora from Chernihiv. Oksana Balandina from the Luhansk region. Svitlana Klymenko and Maria Adamenko from the Kyiv region. Natalia Abashnyk from Kharkiv. With all my heart I thank all the nurses, all the medical workers who help Ukrainians fight every day and every night. And today I urge everyone who has not yet thanked them to do so. Eight years of war in Donbas, two years of pandemic, the third month of full-scale war and all their professional life they dedicate to you, us, everyone - society. So that Ukraine lives. I was very pleased to see the working conditions of our doctors at the Center for Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery in Kyiv. The new building of the Center was built as part of our Large Construction program. And this is a truly modern building. There you feel that our medical system, our medicine can really be on a par with the world's best medical systems. We invested in the development of medicine and all social infrastructure before the war, and we will definitely continue to do so after the war. Let the occupiers not hope that they will stop us. During the fighting since February 24, Russian troops have destroyed 570 healthcare facilities. 101 hospitals were completely destroyed. What is it? This is nonsense. This is barbarism. This is the self-destruction of Russia as a state that at least someone in the world could look at as a cultural nation. Tonight they struck at the Chernihiv region, at schools. Of course, the Russian state is in such conditions that any education only hinders it. But what can be achieved by destroying Ukrainian schools? All Russian commanders who give such orders are just sick. Incurably. But all the hospitals that the occupiers destroyed, all the schools, all the universities that they bombed, all the houses, bridges, businesses - we will rebuild everything. The occupiers struck today at the Poltava region, at Kremenchuk. Again at the plant, so that people do not have fuel. Really sick. At the Zaporizhzhia region, at the cities and villages of Donbas. But what does it give them? Russia's strategic defeat is already obvious to everyone in the world and even to those who still continue to communicate with them. Russia simply lacks courage to admit it so far. They are cowards. And they are trying to hide the truth behind missile, air and artillery strikes. Therefore, our task is to fight until we achieve our goals in this war. Free our land, our people and reliably ensure our security. I spoke with the President of Finland. We discussed Ukraine's European integration and defense cooperation. I also spoke with Slovak President Zuzana Čaputová. I thanked her for the support provided to Ukraine. We agreed on the next steps in the whole spectrum of relations: defense, sanctions, economy, including fuel imports, and further rapprochement with the European Union. I am preparing to continue special formats of communication with friendly societies, in particular with students from partner countries. I will address American students soon. And students from European countries as well. We must spread our Ukrainian ideas and explain at all levels how we, Ukrainians, see life in Europe and the world after this war. A war that changes everything in world politics. I am grateful to the friend of Ukraine, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, for today's address to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. This is an important gesture of support. More importantly, the Netherlands is advocating the abandonment of Russian oil and is ready to do so without delay. I signed decrees awarding our defenders. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Kachur Roman Volodymyrovych, Commander of the 55th separate artillery brigade of the Operational Command ""East"" of the Ground Forces. 269 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 14 of them posthumously. Eternal glory to all who stood up for Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen!  On behalf of all Ukrainians, I would like to thank you for this award. It is a fair and correct gesture to honor with this award all the people of Ukraine, because courage is our national trait of character. Today the whole world witnesses this and admires the heroism of Ukrainians. At the same time, I want it not to become something ordinary for everyone. And for this we must say and remember that behind the courage and wisdom of our people, there are thousands of real stories, names and heroic feats. The world should know about them and to have a clear idea and understanding about the people of Ukraine. First of all, we are the nation of the best defenders. These are our ground forces, air and naval forces, airborne assault troops, special operations forces, the National Guard, intelligence, border guards, and territorial defense fighters. This is Vitalii Skakun, who blew up a bridge sacrificing himself to stop a column of Russian tanks.  This is 21-year-old lieutenant Vitalii Sapilo, who neutralized 30 units of equipment of the enemy and died from an air strike. Serhiy Pantelyuk, who was injured while repelling the attack and died at the hospital while his first daughter was being born. These are the border guards of Zmiinyi Island, who were not afraid of the flagship of the Russian fleet - cruiser Moskva - and sent a Russian ship in a direction that became world-famous. These are the indomitable defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal, who have been holding the line there for several months. These are all our fighters who died defending Ukraine, hence defending Europe. I would like to ask you to honor their memory with a moment of silence. Thank you. The Ukrainian people are people who do not spare themselves for the sake of others. This is combat medic Diana Kukurudziak, who pulled 16 wounded soldiers off the battlefield in one day. Paramedic Serhiy Chornobryvets in Mariupol, who has been on duty for 22 days since the beginning of the war. The Ukrainian people are a nation of courageous children. This is 11-year-old Maksym, who said nothing to his mother, ran away from home and came to ask for permission to be a part of territorial defense. This is 7-year-old Varya from Kropyvnytskyi who gave her money saved for a smartphone to buy bulletproof vests, and then sold flowers and drawings.  This is a 15-year-old girl from the Luhansk region who was driving a car with shot legs and took out four wounded. A 15-year-old boy who carried his wounded mother in his arms for 3 kilometers to the evacuation point. Our people are also elderly people who have experienced too many ordeals. This is Borys Romanchenko, who passed through the hell of Buchenwald and died at the age of 96, at home, during the shelling of Kharkiv by the Russian Federation. This is Vanda Obiedkova, who as a child, hiding in the basement, survived the Holocaust and the Nazi occupation of Mariupol, saw the second occupation of the city in 2014, and the third - this year. At the age of 91, she had to hide in the basement again, where she died on the 40th day of the war. This is 87-year-old Halyna Kotubey from Mykolaiv region, who remained the only and last resident of her village, but refused to leave.  The Ukrainian people are a nation where hundreds of thousands fight and millions help. This is a business that has shifted to the needs of the country. Clothing designers sew military uniforms, restaurateurs feed free lunches, bakeries bake bread for IDPs and lonely people. This is a university professor who continues to lecture to his students in the trenches. A violinist playing for people during an air alarm in a bomb shelter. These are civilians of Ukrainian cities and villages, who became a living wall on the way of the occupiers – stopping military machines and turning tanks in the opposite direction. These are inhabitants of Demydivka, who flooded their own village not to let the occupier into Kyiv. Those who despite threats, shots and stun grenades go to peaceful rallies, reminding the occupants that this is Ukraine: Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol and all other cities and villages of Ukraine occupied not for a long time.  These are millions of Ukrainians who are now defending their Homeland and the whole world. Do not be afraid and come to Ukraine. Hear thousands of similar stories about us, Ukrainians. Look into their brave eyes, shake their strong hands, and you will see that they are doing all this not for glory, that they need not only awards, but also concrete help and support. Weapons, equipment, financial support, sanctions on Russia, and the most important: the feeling that in this difficult struggle they are not alone, that they are supported by you, by the whole world – free states and free nations of our planet. Thank you!  Thank you for your attention!  Thank you for your support!  Thank you for the award and welcome to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Unbreakable people of our country! We have a series of important news - clearly positive for our defense. First. The House of Representatives of the United States Congress voted for a new and significant package of support for our state and global democracy. Almost $ 40 billion. A second vote will be held soon in the US Senate. This decision will then be signed by President Biden and will take effect. I am grateful to the people of America and to all our friends in Congress and Administration for their support. What exactly is positive? These funds will be used as quickly as possible and without bureaucracy to strengthen Ukraine's defense. First of all, it is weapons and ammunition for us, equipment. But not only that. It is also a support for the investigation of war crimes of the Russian Federation, the occupiers, support for diplomatic work and more. The second decision is important and even historic. This is an update of America's famous Lend-Lease program. People who remember history well know that Lend-Lease was one of the key preconditions for the Allied victory in World War II. Lend-Lease assistance from the United States to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union has dramatically changed the balance of power in Europe. Europeans then received a wide range of products under Lend-Lease - from aircraft to trucks, from aviation fuel to communication means. By the way, American radio stations and other things provided under Lend-Lease worked for the Soviet people long after the war. For decades. Hitler's Germany, even with all the resources in the occupied territories, could do nothing to counter this potential of the Allies on the basis of American productive capacities. And it is no coincidence that the new Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act was signed on May 9. I am personally grateful to President Biden for this support, for this decision and for such symbolism. Because we are now defending freedom and the right to life for all free nations in the war against tyranny, which poses no less of a threat to Europe than it did 80 years ago. Simply put, Lend-Lease is a scheme to give us everything we need for defense. Although formally it is like a loan, in fact it is so profitable that it is incorrect to call it a loan. Firstly, we will have access to modern weapons, ammunition, equipment, and we do not need to look for options to pay for it all. Secondly, now the President of the United States will not have to agree with Congress on the assistance he provides. This will speed up the delivery. And there is one more thing that should be said separately. Ukraine is constantly discussing security guarantees for itself with our friends in a very substantive way. The G7 meeting on May 8, in which our state took part for the first time at the level of leaders, was first and foremost about that. We are negotiating with the world's leading nations to give Ukraine confidence in security for decades to come. This is the first time in the history of our state when it is possible to fix such guarantees. Not something in the memorandum, not some declarative desire for some kind of course, but specific guarantees. Not only legally significant, but also spelled out so that it is clear: what exactly, who exactly and how exactly guarantees us. God willing. Of course, all these things will not work in one or several days. But I am sure that this May will be of special significance in Ukrainian history. Yes, Russian troops are still on our land. Those outcasts whom the Russian state has found for itself as collaborators make statements of cosmic scale and cosmic stupidity, as their level was characterized in ""Heart of a Dog"". But no matter what the occupiers do, it doesn't mean anything. They stand no chance. I am confident that we will liberate our land and people. By the way, today in communication with students of French universities I felt such confidence in their questions. And with new support from the United States, with Lend-Lease, with all the help we get from the UK and the European Union, from Canada, Japan, Australia – without exaggeration, from the whole free world – it will be easier for us. I also spoke today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. On defense assistance to Ukraine, energy cooperation and new sanctions. New – against Russia. Step by step, we are doing everything to make the aggressor most hurt by aggression. However, speaking about the help of partners, we must not forget that victory is gained directly by Ukrainians who are fighting. By all who beat the enemy and strengthen the defense. Just yesterday, 404 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine (posthumously) was awarded to Colonel Ihor Bedzay, Chief of the Aviation Security Service - Senior Inspector-Pilot of the Naval Command. In total, more than 13,000 of our servicemen received state awards during the full-scale war. This definitely characterizes the courage of all our defenders. I am grateful to each and every one of them! Very grateful. Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom! Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for us, for everyone. For Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"I am glad to greet you from our capital, from Kyiv. Today is the 77th day of Russia's full-scale war against our state. And it happens 77 years after the end of the largest war in Europe - World War II. When that war ended, political leaders and nations sought to create a security architecture that would make it impossible to repeat the war in Europe. And when I say the word ""security"" now, I use it in the broad sense of the word. It is not only a military component, but also economic, political, educational, cultural and memorial. Europeans have done a lot to ensure that the continent always has the opportunity to resolve any issues through dialogue. Through communication. So that it is not possible for one politician, one person or a group of politicians to provoke a large-scale war again, which will take thousands or even millions of lives. And, by the way, the contribution of students, including French students, to such changes in Europe is extremely significant. Since May 1968, there has been no politician who would not fear that people would come to him and say: it is forbidden to forbid. But why, despite all this, all this history, do we in Europe now have no tool to stop Russian aggression, except the courage and wisdom of Ukrainian men and women who defend our state? How did it happen that the whole security architecture that was created in Europe after World War II did not work? And not only did not work, but to a large extent did not even try. 77 days of brutal Russian war, which can truly be called a total war to destroy the Ukrainian people. Cities and villages in Ukraine were destroyed. You know this. There is nothing left of the city of Volnovakha in Donbas. Before this war about 20 thousand people lived there. Now it's all ashes. The half-million city of Mariupol is now just ruins. How many people are there now? Several tens of thousands out of half a million. At least 20,000 Mariupol residents were killed by Russian strikes at the city. Unfortunately, there are many such examples in Ukraine. Today, 12 million people have been forced to flee the war and become internally displaced persons. More than 10,000 Russian military crimes have been recorded. And this is just what is legally recorded as of this day. How did all this become possible? And why are no global or European institutions enough now to stop this war? You know, I don't want these questions to remain rhetorical. These questions really need to be answered, because these questions are actually about you and me, about Europe. About how we all live. From the Atlantic region to our cities, our communities in the Kharkiv region and in Donbas, which right now, right now, while we are here with you, are being fired upon by Russian troops from artillery, aircraft, and so on. I was told that the rules of our meeting today provide for my address and the opportunity for five students to ask certain questions. I think this is still an unfair regulation. Five questions are not enough to understand a person and to understand the situation. And it will look like a privilege for a few when thousands listen to us. But I understand that you and I have limited time. I'm also interested in asking you questions to hear what you think. So that it is really communication. For example, about NATO. About world security. About the architecture of this security. About the 5th article of the Treaty. For years, Europe has feared Ukraine's accession to NATO, because if a war broke out with Russia - they said so - everyone would have to fight against it. I would rather say - for Ukraine. But isn't that the point of NATO? Isn't that all for one? And if Russia goes further, for example to the Baltic countries, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia - any country. Will NATO fight against Russia, for example, for Latvia? Will Article 5 work then, given that most of you have never been to Latvia and may not even have ties to that country? There is also another aspect to this. Russia has already started a war against Ukraine, but we are not in NATO. And then why are we not in the European Union? Russia has already started a war. And you see how it fights. What else can you be afraid of now? And why does our common European home still have an internal division between those who were admitted and Ukraine? Which is behind the door, but at the same time fighting, defending European values, EU values: freedom and other fundamental values. And here is my second question to you: why did one person, Vladimir Putin, decide to start a war? It was a wrong and catastrophic decision. But why did he still approve it? And is there now in Europe, perhaps even in France or in any other country, a man or woman who can also start such a war against neighbors? Of course, I don't want that for anyone. But are we protected from this? Are you protected from this? One more question of mine to you - why did the Russian military, when occupying the territory of Ukraine, torment people with such pleasure and so massively? Why didn't they just shoot or capture or kill people like in war. Why did they rape, why did they torture people? Why did they cut off people's heads, fingers, why did they break legs? Why did Russian soldiers rape children in front of their parents? How can you - already adults - explain this? In your opinion, did they have just such an order or are they just like that? For example, a nine-year-old girl. Or an eleven-year-old boy. What should be in the head of a Russian soldier who rapes them in front of their parents, in front of their mother? Hundreds of such crimes have been recorded. There was even a Russian soldier who raped a baby and recorded a video of it, and then showed it to everyone. And how many such cases were in the occupied territories, about which we do not know yet? During World War II, the Nazis committed horrific crimes against all the nations of Europe. In particular, against Ukrainians and against Russians. For 77 years, much has been done to preserve the memory of those terrible crimes, which would ensure that they will never happen again. But why did the Russian military, when they came to Ukraine, start doing what the Nazis did? How did this become possible? My next question to you is: when will justice be restored? Why is there still no tool in the world that can bring all war criminals to justice quickly? Exactly quickly. Of course, our state will do everything to bring to justice every war criminal. And I am grateful to everyone who helps us. In particular, France. But there is an aspect of time. How long will it last? When will murderers and torturers receive sentences? And how to get them for trial, if they hide in Russia and if nothing changes there? There are many people of the future and different professions among you, and there are lawyers among you. Let them find the answer. So what can we do to speed up international justice? And what punishment do these criminals deserve? Specifically which one? What could be enough punishment for raping a child or shooting cars with refugees right on the roads just for fun? There were hundreds and thousands of such cases. And my fifth question to you is not difficult - personal. What influences politics and what influences the decision whether to engage in politics? Are you ready to get involved in politics? Would you like your father to be President? President of a state that defends itself in war and fights not just for independence, but literally for the right to life for its people? Or President of France - a state in peace? I want to explain my feelings to you. The feelings when you have a double responsibility - both for the state, because you are the President, and for your family, which found itself in a very special situation. When I decided to run for president, my daughter (she’s now 18) was against it - totally. She was aware of how much life would change. It is a question of publicity, a question of security, certain responsibility - of the children of the President already. What do you think about it? And how would you feel now if you were the son or daughter of the President? So, as I understand, we have little time. And I would like you to give answers to my questions. And I can answer yours. It is important for this meeting of ours to be truly communication. And I would like to hear from you. At the end, I can ask the last question. If I get all the information from you. Thank you for your attention!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today has been a difficult day. There was news - both ordinary and tragic. I'll start with international contacts. I continued to address foreign parliaments. Those states and nations whose support is important to us. And especially now. In my address to the Slovak Parliament, I thanked for the strong defense, sanctions and other support. I explained our view on why energy cooperation with Russia cannot be considered in isolation from the aggressive policy of this country. And on the Ukrainian example, recalling the history of so-called gas friendship with Russia, I showed what mistakes should be avoided. Addressing the Maltese Parliament, I recalled the heroic battle for Malta in World War II, which is very similar in fact to our current struggle in the war for independence and freedom against Russia. Then, 80 years ago, the fate of the entire confrontation in the Mediterranean depended on the battle for Malta. The Allies won. The Nazis lost. We are doing everything to ensure that the confrontation on our land ends in this way now as well. And for this we need principled support and sanctions. In particular, from Malta. I held talks in Kyiv with the foreign ministers of Germany and the Netherlands. We talked about the strengthening of Ukraine, about the faster end of this war. We also discussed the details of how our friends can join the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. I am also grateful to them for resuming the work of embassies in our capital. This is an important gesture that confirms Europe's confidence in Ukraine's future. In total, 36 foreign missions are already operating in the capital. The Armed Forces of our state provided us all with good news from the Kharkiv region. The occupiers are gradually being pushed away from Kharkiv. I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders. Once the second most powerful army in the world. But I also want to urge all our people, and especially those in the rear, not to spread excessive emotions. We shouldn’t create an atmosphere of specific moral pressure, when certain victories are expected weekly and even daily. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to liberate our land and our people. To liberate all our cities - Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Mariupol and all others. Today, a special group of international experts chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak proposed a roadmap for energy sanctions. This is a detailed document that describes what needs to be done to make it really difficult for Russia to finance this war, but at the same time - so that the global economy does not suffer losses due to restrictions on Russian energy resources. This is a rationally drafted document, and work has already begun on its implementation. And the tragic news on which I want to end this address today. The first President of Ukraine Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk died today. He was not just a politician. And not just a historical figure. He was the man who knew how to find wise words and say them so that all Ukrainians could hear them. This is especially important in difficult, crisis moments. When the future of an entire country may depend on the wisdom of one person. Leonid Makarovych showed just such wisdom in the late 1980s, when the Ukrainian movement emerged. He passed 1991 brilliantly, and it is only now that it may seem as if it was easy for him then. And no matter what happened later, Leonid Kravchuk always stayed with Ukraine. Perhaps it was because of his wisdom that he was cheerful in a special way. He always valued life, every minute of it. But he always found much more than one minute to help sort things out and give advice. And I am personally grateful to him in particular for that. As a child he survived World War II, survived the occupation. Leonid Makarovych knew what freedom costs. And with all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine. I'm sure we will implement it. We will achieve our victory and our peace. Eternal honor and memory to the first President of independent Ukraine! Eternal memory to all who defended Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear parliamentarians! Dear journalists! Dear Slovak people! Pozdravujem Vás s Kyjiva! It is an honor for me to address you today. And I want to start with words of gratitude for all the help that Slovakia has given to Ukraine. We greatly appreciate your defense support. And your determination in this support, which proves that you realize that freedom without force is just a fantasy and nothing more. It would be good if some other countries in Europe and the world learn this from you. We appreciate your solidarity with Ukraine at the level of the European Union. This was the case before February 24, when Russia launched a full-scale war and so it is now. Last year, we, with your President, Ms. Zuzana Čaputová, signed a Declaration of Recognition of the European Perspective of Ukraine. The significance of that step has now only grown stronger. Russia's war against our state is not only an attempt to seize our land, subdue our people and erase Ukrainian identity. Russia went to war in fact against all of united Europe, starting with Ukraine. This war is actually being waged by Russia against each of the states that want to live freely and choose their own future. That want to choose which unions to be in, who to be friends with and how to trade. This war is against the very project of a common alliance based on common values on our continent. What are these values? Respect for life, human rights, inviolability of borders and freedom. Last week, Bucha and Borodyanka were also visited by your colleagues from the Slovak Parliament. They also saw with their own eyes what evil Russia is carrying. Thousands of crimes by Russian occupiers against civilians have been recorded in the Kyiv region alone. Murders, torture, abductions, looting and robberies have been reported. It is recorded that the occupiers tried to destroy everything that is connected not only with the Ukrainian national idea, but also simply with culture. What is the point of shelling and destroying schools in the area where the occupiers entered? They even destroyed schools! What does this mean? That we are at the epicenter of the confrontation of two ideas: the European democratic idea that the freedom and life of everyone matters and the cruel tyrannical idea that only a person who can subdue other people matters. That's what we need to stop together. Everyone in Europe. Because if we don't stop it, Russian troops will repeat the crimes they committed in Bucha and Borodyanka on the land of every state they can reach, in particular on the territory of your state. So the first and foremost tool to win this confrontation is weapons. And I can say on behalf of all our people that Ukrainians will always remember how Slovakia gave our country at a crucial time what really helped us. And there is potential to continue this cooperation, in particular, in the issue of aviation – aircraft, helicopters. You know, our flag, which is now very often seen by all Europeans in their cities – I am grateful to them – it reflects our fertile land – fields of yellow wheat. And also our beautiful blue sky. We have people to defend our land. But in the skies we need more support, including yours. The second tool is sanctions against Russia. Together with the use of effective weapons by our Armed Forces, sanctions create a truly reliable protection for the European idea. Because if the source of aggression weakens, life becomes more secure for everyone in Europe. The European Union is now agreeing on the sixth package of sanctions against Russia. And this is the required package, including the energy restrictions that are provided for in it. I understand that this is a challenge for you and some other countries. For Slovakia, the issue of Russian oil and the possibility of its replacement is not a matter of immediate action. We understand everything. But I want to give you, as our friends, one Ukrainian example. To make you better understand us. For a long time, Russian politicians have been fighting for the supply of Russian gas to Ukraine. They offered various supposedly profitable options – completely non-market, cheap and convenient, especially for Moscow. They offered to get a political decision from us about a larger volume of supplies and an easier scheme of payment for Russian gas. Not so long ago, Ukraine was one of the biggest sales destinations for Gazprom. What did it lead to? Ukraine depended not only on Russian gas, but also on Russian political decisions. And any attempt to move at least to market conditions in supply ended in gas wars, and ultimately in a bonded gas agreement, which posed a direct threat to our sovereignty. Ukrainian politicians have also been playing for a long time with the issue of placing the Russian Black Sea Fleet on the territory of Ukraine – in our Crimea. In particular, they talked about the conditions of the so-called lease for the fleet, linking the gas issue to this. It seems that there may be some benefit to the state from the feigned discount on Russian gas when the Russian fleet remains on Ukrainian territory. While this fleet was just a cover to capture a territory. An umbrella for issuing passports to our people by Russia – our people in Crimea. For propaganda and creeping annexation, which could only be completed by the invasion, and it happened in 2014. That's what happened in our history. And this is what I advise all our friends, who may become at least one percent more politically dependent on Russia, to avoid. We were the first to see Russia breaking agreements when it simply stopped liking them. We saw Russia turn commercial ties into a chain to keep another state close to it. The Russian Black Sea Fleet was used to capture Crimea. And now it is blocking the sea for us and firing missiles at our peaceful cities. Well, Russia is trying to use gas now to have the entire European continent obedient.   Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Slovak people! Ukraine has gone through the mistakes that our friends can learn. Russian energy is not just a commodity. It should be abandoned, especially oil, because it's really a question of freedom. Yes, protecting freedom has a price. And the third aspect I would like to talk about today. This is the future of the European Union. Russia's attempts to blackmail, split and weaken Europeans clearly show that all of us on the continent must respond with even greater unity. Even greater integration. Even with greater joint protection of our values. This is an important element of the very force that makes freedom not just a fantasy. Even more unity in Europe is possible only in one case – if Ukraine right now, in the conditions of war, gets a real opportunity to move faster to the European Union. The issue of granting EU membership candidate status to Ukraine in June this year is a matter of protecting the entire European project. As well as the issue of economic support for Ukraine. It is impossible to fight without the economy. And Russia is doing everything to destroy our economy. As an example, most of the Russian missiles that hit Ukrainian land hit the economic infrastructure. Therefore, the priority is to establish alternative routes for our exports, in particular, through the territory of Slovakia. And greater financial support for Ukraine from the European Union. And I ask you to be our voice in the European Union when it comes to defending the relevant positions from the destructive doubts of those who value freedom less than you. After more than two months of the full-scale war, Ukrainians, together with all our friends on the European continent who have shown solidarity in defending freedom, have proved that Moscow will never be able to repeat what it did in 1968 and all other attempts to spread tyranny. By the way, this is how I interpret the decision to award me your State Award of Alexander Dubček. I am grateful for it. But to really fully respond to the mockery of freedom then, in 1968, and to the attempts to mock freedom now, we still have to fight. We must strengthen our unity and put pressure on Russia until we see that victory has been achieved. I know that a donors' conference will be held in Bratislava in June to activate assistance for Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who participates in its organization, including the GLOBSEC think tank. And I believe that we will be able to discuss specific projects to restore normal life in different regions of Ukraine at this Bratislava site. Because the more actively we cooperate, the more we put pressure on Russia. And the more we strengthen European unity, the clearer the contours of our victory are. Our victory. Thank you, Slovakia!

0,"Ukrainians! Unbreakable people of our country! Today, we have taken another step - a very important and not just a formal step - on our path to the European Union. Ukraine has submitted the second part of the answers to a special questionnaire to be completed by each country aspiring to be part of the European Union. It usually takes months. But we did everything in a few weeks. This is a document that contains thousands of pages. And it was today that I held talks about our European integration with both Charles Michel, President of the European Council, and Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. I thanked them on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for their support for our country. For attention to our needs and especially now - in this difficult time of war. I also thanked the President of the European Commission for the work on creating a Trust Fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war, after the victory. And for the efforts needed to agree on a new package of sanctions on Russia. President Charles Michel visited our Odesa today. He saw with his own eyes what the blocked sea means. For the first time in decades there is no usual movement of the merchant fleet, no usual port functioning in Odesa. Probably this has never happened in Odesa since World War II. Ordinary life related to the sea is blocked by Russia. Exactly Russia. And this affects not only Ukraine. Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. And over time, the situation can become downright terrible. Politicians are already discussing the possible consequences of the price crisis and famine in Africa and Asia. This is a direct consequence of Russian aggression, which can be overcome only together - by all Europeans, by the whole free world. It can be overcome by putting pressure on Russia, by effectively forcing Russia to stop this disgraceful war. And, by the way, today - despite the presence of the President of the European Council - the Russian military again launched a missile strike at the Odesa region. This is the real attitude of Russia to Europe. And it has always been so. Whatever they say in Moscow. I met in Kyiv with Secretary General of the Council of Europe Marija Pejčinović Burić. We discussed what can be done for peace in Ukraine and Europe with the tools of this esteemed institution. I am grateful for the support of our state by visiting our capital on this day. Europe Day. And Day of Victory over Nazism. Usually on May 9, Europeans recalled the price of peace that was paid by all the nations of our continent 77 years ago. They talked about how to prevent the recurrence of such a terrible war. It is clear that now everything is different. In European capitals, the main topic is the price of peace that will have to be paid to stop the war unleashed by Russia. And also the price for Russia for bringing the evil of total war of destruction of our people to Europe again. I'm sure this is also the main topic in Moscow now. They can show anything in propaganda - let it be. And make any political statements. But the reality cannot be changed. Reality requires peace. And the only culprit that peace has been destroyed is and will be the Russian state. This is a historical responsibility of Russia. Well, we, Ukrainians, continue to work for our defense, victory and restoration of justice. Today, tomorrow and any other day needed for the liberation of Ukraine from the occupiers. I am grateful to all our defenders. I am grateful to all those who defend the Kharkiv region, defend Donbas, defend the south of Ukraine. Who do not give up and are waiting for the Ukrainian flag in all those cities that are temporarily - I emphasize this: temporarily - captured by the occupiers. Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Enerhodar, Mariupol, all other cities, all our other communities. The Ukrainian flag will return. Because this is our country. Free European country. Our state.

0,"Great people of great Ukraine! ""There is nothing more dangerous than an insidious enemy, but there is nothing more poisonous than a feigned friend."" These are the words of the great Ukrainian philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda. On February 24, we realized this truth when a feigned friend started a war against Ukraine. This is not a war of two armies. This is a war of two worldviews. The war waged by barbarians who shell the Skovoroda Museum and believe that their missiles can destroy our philosophy. It annoys them. It is unfamiliar to them. It scares them. Its essence is that we are free people who have their own path. Today we are waging war on this path and we will not give anyone a single piece of our land. Today we celebrate the Day of Victory over Nazism. And we will not give anyone a single piece of our history. We are proud of our ancestors who, together with other nations in the anti-Hitler coalition, defeated Nazism. And we will not allow anyone to annex this victory, we will not allow it to be appropriated. Our enemy dreamed that we would refuse to celebrate May 9 and the victory over Nazism. So that the word ""denazification"" gets a chance. Millions of Ukrainians fought Nazism and went through a difficult and long journey. The Nazis were expelled from Luhansk, the Nazis were expelled from Donetsk, and Kherson, Melitopol and Berdyansk were liberated from the occupiers. The Nazis were expelled from Yalta, Simferopol, Kerch and the entire Crimea. Mariupol was liberated from the Nazis. They expelled the Nazis from all over Ukraine, but the cities I named are especially inspiring us today. They give us faith that we will drive the occupiers out of our own land for sure. On the Day of Victory over Nazism, we are fighting for a new victory. The road to it is difficult, but we have no doubt that we will win. What is our advantage over the enemy? We are smarter by one book. This is a textbook on the history of Ukraine. We would not know grief if all our enemies could read and draw the right conclusions. On February 24, Russia launched an offensive. Treading on the same rake. Every occupier who comes to our land treads on it. We have been through different wars. But they all had the same final. Our land was sown with bullets and shells, but no enemy was able to take root here. Enemy chariots and tanks drove through our fields, but it did not bear fruit. Enemy arrows and missiles flew in our skies, but no one will be able to overshadow our blue sky. There are no shackles that can bind our free spirit. There is no occupier who can take root in our free land. There is no invader who can rule over our free people. Sooner or later we win. Despite the horde, despite Nazism, despite the mixture of the first and the second, which is the current enemy, we win, because this is our land. Because someone is fighting for the father tsar, the führer, the party and the chief, and we are fighting for the Homeland. We have never fought against anyone. We always fight for ourselves. For our freedom. For our independence. So that the victory of our ancestors was not in vain. They fought for freedom for us and won. We are fighting for freedom for our children, and therefore we will win. We will never forget what our ancestors did in World War II. Where more than eight million Ukrainians died. And every fifth Ukrainian didn’t return home. In total, the war claimed at least 50 million lives. We do not say ""we can repeat"". Because only a madman can wish to repeat the 2194 days of war. The one who is repeating the horrific crimes of Hitler’s regime today, following Nazi philosophy, copying everything they did. He is doomed. Because he was cursed by millions of ancestors when he began to imitate their killer. And therefore he will lose everything. And very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine. And someone will not have even one left. We won then. We will win now, too! And Khreshchatyk will see the parade of victory - the victory of Ukraine! Congratulations on the Victory Day over Nazism!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders. Today is an important day, very important. For us. For our people. For our freedom. It was here, at the Mariyinsky Palace, that I held talks today with my friend, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. I am grateful to Justin for visiting our country. Exactly now, exactly on this day. A powerful sign of support and faith in the future of our people. Among other things, Canada has a strong potential in mine clearance. We expect that this potential will be used in Ukraine - where the Russian occupiers left thousands of mines, tripwire mines, shells. For the first time, Ukraine took part in a meeting of G7 leaders. The world's largest democracies. I outlined our vision of what needs to be done for freedom to win and to guarantee Ukraine's security. I called for increasing sanctions on Russia and creating conditions for Ukraine so that the war ends as soon as possible with the liberation of our land and our people. In particular, this applies to the embargo on Russian oil, oil blends and petroleum products. I invited the leading states - our friends - to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. We agreed on a joint statement by the G7 on the war, global threats posed by Russia and our respect for the common historical heritage, our common values and the importance of freedom. The statement is in the interests of Ukraine as much as possible and will become the basis of our further cooperation. And the main thing I felt today was the world's even greater willingness to help us. And the fact that we have already achieved a historic result, because it is clear to the whole free world that Ukraine is the party of good in this war. And Russia will lose, because evil always loses. I held talks with Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenković in Kyiv. Croatia fundamentally and strongly supports our state in the struggle for independence. I am grateful to Croatia for everything we have already received. And I hope that in the future the cooperation will only grow. I also had a meeting with the President of the Norwegian Storting in Kyiv. The conversation was very emotional, so that you feel: they are worried about us, our fate as about themselves. And really try to help. I am grateful for that. I also spoke with the President of the German Bundestag. First of all, about Germany's further defensive assistance in our fight against tyranny. About how German leadership in the European Union can help us. Bono, U2, also visited Ukraine today. I am grateful to him for supporting our people and drawing even more attention to the need to help our people. Well, I am sure that this day in Ukraine has shown that we are already a full-fledged part of the free world and a united Europe. This is an obvious contrast to Moscow's loneliness in evil and hatred that everyone will see tomorrow. The Russian army would not be itself if it did not kill today - on the eve of certainly important days for any European. As a result of the Russian air strike at Bilohorivka, Luhansk region, about 60 people were killed. Civilians who simply hid in the school from the shelling. It was a targeted strike at the school. Another crime of the occupiers. Another missile strike at the Odesa region, again hitting a residential building. Again shelling in the Sumy region. Violent shelling in Donbas and the Kharkiv region. As if today is not May 8. As if tomorrow is not May 9, when peace should be the main word. For all normal people. Russia has forgotten everything that was important to the victors of World War II. But Ukraine and the whole free world will remind it. So that then no one will forget. So that really important words - ""never again"" - which are repeated all over the free world every year on the days of remembrance of the victims of World War II regain their weight again. I am grateful to all our defenders who are defending and saving Ukraine from the modern descendants of that old evil. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal glory to all our warriors! I am grateful to all the friends of Ukraine and freedom! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"I am thankful to all the respected leaders for this opportunity and for the fact that it is happening today, on this day exactly. This is a powerful support for our state. Dear friends! We are meeting on this day in such a format to determine what needs to be done to stop Russia's war against Ukraine. Today, May 8, is a key day of remembrance for all the victims of World War II, for the fragility of peace and the inadmissibility of any anti-humanist regimes. But what is remembrance for others today, for our people is, unfortunately, just news, every day. Just yesterday in the village of Bilohorivka, Luhansk region, a Russian bomb killed 60 people. Civilians. They were hiding from shelling in the building of a regular school, which was attacked by a Russian air strike. To do so is to imitate precisely the evil that the Nazis brought to Europe. The missile strikes at Odesa and our other cities are an imitation of how the Nazis tried to bomb and destroy European cities by bombardment. The deportation of more than 500,000 Ukrainians to Russia and the so-called ""filtration camps"" set up by Russian troops in the occupied territories of Ukraine are imitations of the deportations and concentration camps that the Nazis organized in Europe. Every day our people see and die from what must have been left in the distant past. What definitely shouldn’t have returned to Europe 77 years after. But, unfortunately, I state: it's back. That is why the solidarity of the whole free world has returned. That is why such historical concepts as ""Lend-Lease"" and ""Marshall Plan"" have returned. I am grateful to the United States and our European colleagues for these initiatives. That is why we are reunited in an anti-war coalition to save democracy and freedom in Europe, to guarantee peace and security. I am grateful to you for this solidarity and for this unification. But what do we need now to gain victory in defending freedom? Freedom of Ukraine and the whole world? First of all, weapons. I am grateful to you for the defensive assistance we have already received. Because, as in World War II, the fate of freedom is decided on the battlefield. So Ukraine must get all the weapons and all the defense equipment that will help defeat tyranny. In particular, the M142 HIMARS, M270 MLRS and other weapons that Ukraine has requested from your powerful states. If we had them, we would have been able to save many people. In all those cities, in all those communities that fell victim to the Russian occupiers, like Bilohorivka, which I mentioned at the beginning, or Mariupol. The second is sanctions. Ukraine will always be grateful to you for unprecedented sanctions in the interests of peace. But the war still continues. Hence, a special international group of experts chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak has developed an Action Plan to strengthen sanctions on Russia for this war. It is necessary - I beg you - to implement these sanctions and at least give your feedback. No export-import operations with Russia! As long as Russia is spending the money it has earned on destroying freedom in Ukraine and throughout Europe. The democratic world must be principled in defending itself. We need to look for ways to influence those politicians and those companies that help Russia circumvent sanctions. For example, we transport oil to Hungary through our pipeline. And the politicians of this country not only block the supply of fuel to our territory, but also try to slow down every sanction step against Russia, including the oil embargo. The free world must not allow itself to be manipulated. Also, all Russian officials, law enforcement officials and, importantly, judges who work for tyranny must be on the sanctions list. They are not there yet. Every Russian war criminal must be brought to justice and convicted through international cooperation. Visa restrictions are also needed for Russian citizens so that they do not use the free world for entertainment and shopping. Everyone must fight against tyranny, not adapt to it. The third important point is financial support for Ukraine now and post-war reconstruction. Just as the Marshall Plan played a historic role in rebuilding Europe and creating new conditions for development and growth after World War II, a similar Plan is needed and it is needed now. For the world to see that freedom wins not only on the battlefield, but also in life. As long as the war continues, we need $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion a month in support. When the war is over, we will have to rebuild everything destroyed by Russia for a sum exceeding $ 600 billion. This is a lot for our state. This is not possible for Ukraine. But this is possible for you. And it's not just expenditures for you. Financial assistance to Ukraine and assistance with post-war reconstruction is the prevention of much greater losses of the free world in the future. Russia wants to move on to Europe, and all the potential aggressors in the world, who also want to ruin the lives of their neighbors, are looking to see if Russia succeeds now and if they are able to repeat it. We must organize the work on the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war so that the best experience of democratic countries can be applied with maximum efficiency. In particular, we invite the friends of Ukraine to join the reconstruction, taking patronage over the regions, cities or industries in our country that have suffered from the war, that are destroyed. For example, the United Kingdom has already been invited to take patronage over the restoration of the de-occupied Kyiv region. And today, given Germany's presidency in the G7, I propose to apply the format of cooperation that has shown its effectiveness in the unification of the German state. When it is clearly set who is involved in the restoration and reintegration of the normal life of each region, each city, each community it guarantees efficiency. Such cooperation will strengthen economic and technological ties in Europe and will benefit not only our country, but also your countries, your regions and your companies. I am also grateful to the European Union and the United Kingdom for their decision to abolish tariffs and quotas on our trade. This is a powerful step in support of our state and freedom in general. And this is the decision that would be fair to expect from our other partners. I appeal to all participants of the G7. It is time to remove bilateral barriers in trade. Everything I have said now is, in fact, elements of one question. The question is how long this war will last and how much destruction, how many victims Ukraine will suffer. We must do everything we can to end the war as soon as possible with the victory of freedom. For the longer the war, the greater the benefits of tyranny and the greater the loss of freedom. And not only in Ukraine, but throughout Europe. The lives of more than ten million people in Ukraine who have become IDPs have already been destroyed. But the world is also on the verge of a food crisis because of Russia's actions. The Chancellor also spoke about this now. So how many more millions of lives will be lost in dozens of countries in Africa and Asia as a result of food shortages and political chaos that will follow rising food prices? We need an effective tool for the world's food security. And we propose to create it. If we have an Organization of grain exporting countries that respect international law, value democracy and strive to protect human rights, including the right to life and guaranteed well-being, we will be able to provide food stability and a historic victory over famine. Ukraine is ready to present all the details of this proposal at the appropriate working level. Friends! I commend the efforts of each of you. I am grateful to each of you for the weapons, sanctions and support. But I'm sure you realize that we need more weapons, more sanctions, more support to guarantee the protection of freedom. And to fix security for decades by concluding a relevant effective agreement with clear guarantees for Ukraine. I offer your states - the world's largest democracies - to become guarantors of security for Ukraine. Because this is what guarantees security for the whole center and east of Europe. Therefore, guarantees the confidence of your people that freedom always wins. Thanks again to every country, to every leader present. Thank you for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Can spring be black and white? Is there eternal February? Are golden words devalued? Unfortunately, Ukraine knows the answers to all these questions. Unfortunately, the answers are “yes”. Every year on May 8, together with the entire civilized world, we honor everyone who defended the planet from Nazism during World War II. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. This year we say ""Never again"" differently. We hear ""Never again"" differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it. On February 24, the word ""never"" was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4 am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again! The city of Borodyanka is one of the many victims of this crime! Behind me is one of many witnesses! Not a military facility, not a secret base, but a simple nine-story building. Can it pose a security threat to Russia, to 1/8 of the land, the world's second army, a nuclear state? Can anything be more absurd than this question? It can. 250kg high explosive bombs, with which the superpower shelled this small town. And it went numb. It cannot say today: never again! It cannot say anything today. But here everything is clear without words. Just look at this house. There used to be walls here. They once had photos on them. And in the photos there were those who once went through the hell of war. Fifty men who were sent to Germany for forced labor. Those who were burned alive when the Nazis burned more than 100 houses here. 250 soldiers who died on the fronts of World War II, and a total of almost 1000 residents of Borodyanka who fought and defeated Nazism. To ensure: never again. They fought for the future of children, for the life that was here until February 24. Imagine people going to bed in each of these apartments. They wish good night to each other. Turn off the light. Hug their loved ones. Close their eyes. They dream of something. There is complete silence. They all fall asleep, not knowing that not everyone will wake up. They sleep soundly. They have a dream of something pleasant. But in a few hours they will be awakened by missile explosions. And someone will never wake up again. Never again. The word ""never"" was dropped from this slogan. Amputated during the so-called special operation. They stabbed a knife in the heart and, looking into the eyes, said: ""It's not us!"" Tortured with the words ""not everything is so unambiguous."" Killed ""Never again"", saying: ""We can repeat."" And so it happened. And the monsters began to repeat. And our cities, which survived such a heinous occupation that 80 years are not enough to forget about it, saw the occupier again. And got the second date of occupation in their history. And some cities, such as Mariupol, got the third. During the two years of occupation, the Nazis killed 10,000 civilians there. In two months of occupation, Russia killed 20,000. Decades after World War II, darkness returned to Ukraine. And it became black and white again. Again! Evil has returned. Again! In a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose. A bloody reconstruction of Nazism was organized in Ukraine. A fanatical repetition of this regime. Its ideas, actions, words and symbols. Maniacal detailed reproduction of its atrocities and ""alibi"", which allegedly give an evil sacred purpose. Repetition of its crimes and even attempts to surpass the ""teacher"" and move him from the pedestal of the greatest evil in human history. Set a new world record for xenophobia, hatred, racism and the number of victims they can cause. Never again! It was an ode of a wise man! Anthem of the civilized world! But someone sang out of tune. Distorted ""Never again"" with notes of doubt. Silenced, beginning his deadly aria of evil. And this is clear to all countries that have seen the horrors of Nazism with their own eyes. And today they are experiencing a terrible deja vu. See it again! All nations who have been branded ""third-class"", slaves without the right to their own state or to exist at all hear statements that exalt one nation and erase others with ease. They claim that you don't really exist, you are artificially created, and therefore you have no rights. Everyone hears the language of evil. Again! And together they acknowledge the painful truth: we have not withstood even a century. Our Never again was enough for 77 years. We missed the evil. It was reborn. Again and now! This is understood by all countries and nations who support Ukraine today. And despite the new mask of the beast, they recognized him. Because, unlike some, they remember what our ancestors fought for and against. They did not confuse the first with the second, did not change their places, did not forget. The Poles didn’t forget, on whose land the Nazis began their march and fired the first shot of World War II. Didn't forget how evil first accuses you, provokes you, calls you an aggressor, and then attacks at 4:45 am saying it's self-defense. And they saw how it repeated on our land. They remember the Nazi-destroyed Warsaw. And they see what was done to Mariupol. The British people did not forget how the Nazis wiped out Coventry, which was bombed 41 times. How the ""Moonlight Sonata"" from the Luftwaffe sounded, when the city was continuously bombed for 11 hours. How its historic center, factories, St. Michael's Cathedral were destroyed. And they saw missiles hit Kharkiv. How its historic center, factories and the Assumption Cathedral were damaged. They remember London being bombed for 57 nights in a row. Remember how V-2 hit Belfast, Portsmouth, Liverpool. And they see cruise missiles hit Mykolaiv, Kramatorsk, Chernihiv. They remember how Birmingham was bombed. And they see its sister city Zaporizhzhia being damaged. The Dutch remember this. How Rotterdam became the first city to be completely destroyed when the Nazis dropped 97 tons of bombs on it. The French remember this. Remember Oradour-sur-Glane, where the SS burned half a thousand women and children alive. Mass hangings in Tulle, the massacre in the village of Ascq. Thousands of people at a resistance rally in occupied Lille. They saw what was done in Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Volnovakha and Trostyanets. They see the occupation of Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk and other cities where people do not give up. And thousands of them go to peaceful rallies, which are beyond the power of the occupiers, and all they can do is shoot at civilians. The Czechs have not forgotten this. How in less than a day, the Nazis destroyed Lidice, leaving only ashes from the village. They saw Popasna destroyed. There are not even ashes left from it. The Greeks, who survived massacres and executions throughout the territory, the blockade and the Great Famine, have not forgotten. This is remembered by Americans who fought evil on two fronts. Who passed Pearl Harbor and Dunkirk with the Allies. And together we are going through new, no less difficult battles. This is remembered by all Holocaust survivors - how one nation can hate another. Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Danes, Georgians, Armenians, Belgians, Norwegians and many others have not forgotten this - all those who suffered from Nazism on their land and all those who defeated it in the anti-Hitler coalition. Unfortunately, there are those who, having survived all these crimes, having lost millions of people who fought for victory and gained it, have desecrated the memory of them and their feat today. The one who allowed the shelling of the cities of Ukraine from his land. The cities that, along with our ancestors, were liberated by his ancestors. The one who spat in the face of his ""Immortal Regiment"", placing torturers from Bucha next to it. And challenged all mankind. But forgot the main thing: any evil always ends the same - it ends. Fellow Ukrainians! Today, on the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, we pay homage to all those who defended their homeland and the world from Nazism. We note the feat of the Ukrainian people and their contribution to the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition. Explosions, shots, trenches, wounds, famine, bombing, blockades, mass executions, punitive operations, occupation, concentration camps, gas chambers, yellow stars, ghettos, Babyn Yar, Khatyn, captivity, forced labor. They died so that each of us knows what these words mean from books, not from our own experience. But it happened differently. This is unfair to them all. But the truth will win. And we will overcome everything! And the proof of this is called ""Werewolf"". This is Hitler's former headquarters and bunker near Vinnytsia. And all that is left of it is a few stones. Ruins. The ruins of a person who considered himself great and invincible. This is a guide for all of us and future generations. What our ancestors fought for. And proved that no evil can avoid responsibility. Will not be able to hide in the bunker. There will be no stone left of it. So we will overcome everything. And we know this for sure, because our military and all our people are descendants of those who overcame Nazism. So they will win again. And there will be peace again. Finally again! We will overcome the winter, which began on February 24, lasts on May 8, but will definitely end, and the Ukrainian sun will melt it! And we will meet our dawn together with the whole country. And family and loved ones, friends and relatives will be together again! Finally again! And over the temporarily occupied cities and villages our flag will fly again. Finally again! And we will get together. And there will be peace! Finally again! And no more black and white dreams, only a blue and yellow dream. Finally again! Our ancestors fought for this. Eternal honor to all who fought against Nazism! Eternal memory to all those killed during World War II!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Last night, the Russian army fired a missile to destroy the Hryhorii Skovoroda Museum in the Kharkiv region. A missile. To destroy the museum. Museum of the philosopher and poet who lived in the XVIII century. Who taught people what a true Christian attitude to life is and how a person can get to know himself. Well, it seems that this is a terrible danger for modern Russia - museums, the Christian attitude to life and people's self-knowledge. Every day of this war, the Russian army does something that is beyond words. But every next day it does something that makes you feel it in a new way. Targeted missile strikes at museums - this is not even every terrorist can think of. But such an army is fighting against us. This is what they want to bring to other European countries. As of May 7, the Russian army destroyed or damaged nearly 200 cultural heritage sites already. Today, the invaders launched a missile strike at Odesa. At a city where almost every street has something memorable, something historical. But for the Russian army, it doesn't matter. They would only kill and destroy. Odesa? Kharkiv region? Donbas? They do not care. Only the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the resistance of our people can stop this inhuman invasion. It's barbarism that has missiles, but has nothing to do with people. Such actions of the Russian occupiers, especially on the eve of the Day of Remembrance of all victims of World War II and the Day of Victory over Nazism, should remind every state and every nation that it is impossible to defeat evil once and for all. Unfortunately, evil tends to return when people disrespect other people's rights, disregard the law and destroy culture. This is exactly what happened to the Russian state. That is why we all have to defend ourselves now. Defend our people, our cities and even our museums, which are becoming targets for Russian missile strikes. I am grateful to the teams of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations for helping us carry out the first phase of the Azovstal evacuation mission. More than 300 people were saved - women and children. Virtually, we evacuated civilians from Azovstal. And we are now preparing the second stage of the evacuation mission - the wounded and medics. Of course, if everyone fulfills the agreements. Of course, if there are no lies. Of course, we are also working to evacuate our military. All heroes who defend Mariupol. This is extremely difficult. But it is important. I'm sure everyone understands the root cause of this complication, as well as where the cause is located. But we do not lose hope. We do not stop. Every day we are looking for a diplomatic option that can work out. Tomorrow, our team is preparing the further work of humanitarian corridors for all residents of Mariupol and surrounding settlements. I held a meeting today on the activities of the executive branch. The main issues are economic. In particular, on providing Ukrainians with fuel. On overcoming the fuel shortage that arose after Russian missiles destroyed our Kremenchuk plant and oil depots across the country. I heard reports on what is being done specifically to organize the supply of sufficient gasoline and other fuel types to Ukraine. The key task for government officials is to speed up the transportation of fuel from European ports to our consumers. The volume of such transportation should increase daily. I also heard a report from the Minister of Finance on the execution of the state budget. We are doing everything to ensure that the state fulfills all its social obligations despite the budget deficit and the deliberate destruction of our economy by the Russian army. The preparation of the Post-War Recovery Plan was also discussed. This is a very large-scale task. But I have no doubt that we will implement it. Today I was in Borodyanka, Kyiv region. Which is gradually returning to normal life. Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak together with Minister of Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov inspected the restored railway bridge over the Irpin River - it is already open for transport. Today we can say that the cities and communities of the Kyiv region liberated from the occupiers are provided with normal transport connections. I also traditionally signed decrees in the evening to award our defenders. 216 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Oleh Irodiyovych Hehechkora (posthumously), Commander of the helicopter squadron of the 11th separate brigade of the army aviation of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Eternal glory to all who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! I wish you health! Today was a busy day, which began and ended with awarding our heroes, our defenders. On the occasion of Infantry Day - a professional holiday of Ukrainian warriors who are the foundation of the army, I met with our servicemen in the morning. Thanked them for their service. Presented awards. Including our new - combat - award. You know that since independence there have been no combat awards in our country. And today I had the honor to finally present such an award. The Cross of Military Merit. And the first person to whom I decided to present this Cross was General Valerii Zaluzhny, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For courage, for wisdom, for organizing an effective rebuff to the Russian invasion. I am sure the Russian army will remember such a rebuff for a long time. Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Lieutenant General Yevhen Moysiuk, combat medic of the 72nd separate mechanized brigade, Sergeant Dariya Mazurenko, Commander of the 14th separate mechanized brigade, Colonel Oleksandr Okhrimenko, Deputy Commander of the mechanized battalion of the 72nd separate mechanized brigade, Captain Vladyslav Kaliyevsky received the same award.  Combat awards are a fair new tradition for the state, which defends its independence on the battlefield. A special award ""For Courage and Bravery"" was also established for combat units that showed extraordinary courage and effectiveness in the battles for Ukraine. It was received by 7 brigades. I also presented the Orders of the Golden Star to our defenders who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. And also to the relatives of those of our heroes who were posthumously awarded this title. We continue the evacuation mission from Mariupol, from Azovstal, with the mediation of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. During the day, our team organized rescue for more than 40 civilians - women and children. We hope that soon they will be able to arrive in a safe area after two months of shelling, just underground - in shelters. We are also working on diplomatic options to save our military who still remain at Azovstal. Influential mediators are involved. Influential states. Russian troops continued the shelling of our territory, including missile and air strikes. I ask all our citizens - especially these days - not to ignore the air raid sirens. Please, this is your life, the life of your children. Also, strictly follow the public order and curfew regulations in cities and communities. Be sure to comply with the ban on visiting forests in the territories that were occupied. A great threat of mines and tripwire mines left after the Russian military remains there. I met in Kyiv with the foreign ministers of the three Baltic states. They consistently support our struggle against the Russian invasion. Support from the first day. I am very grateful. And today, as always, we talked thoroughly and for the benefit of Ukraine. We are coordinating our steps to increase pressure on Russia. And this is especially important now - when the European Union is preparing a new, already sixth, sanctions package on Russia. I also took part in a discussion at the very influential British expert platform Chatham House. It is one of the most important international platforms for political work and lobbying - in the good sense of the word - useful government decisions. I have outlined our initiative to update the global security architecture. So that the tools for a really quick reaction to any external aggression finally appear in the world. Addressed the Parliament of Iceland. Thanked the Government and the people of Iceland for supporting the sanctions that are needed to deter Russia. I also called on Icelandic politicians, diplomats and ordinary citizens to help defend our freedom. Urged them to be advocates of freedom. Advocates of Ukraine. Because we have a common freedom with them. Just as with all other nations of the free world. This is the extraordinary strength of the Ukrainian position. We defend ourselves against the onslaught of tyranny craving to destroy everything that freedom gives to people and states. And such a struggle - for freedom and against tyranny - is quite comprehensible for any society, in any corner of our planet. In the evening I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. Our brave defenders thanks to whom Ukraine has survived and is holding on despite everything that Russia is trying to do to break us. Therefore, 203 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded. And 16 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate. Once again, I congratulate all warriors in infantry units on their professional holiday. Glory to all our defenders! Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Godan dag thetta er Volodymir Zelensky i Kaenugardi! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today in this format. It is a great honor for me to speak in the Althing, the oldest parliament in the free world. And what else can we talk about now, if not freedom - the most ancient value which people have fought for and continue to fight. Which we are fighting for now in Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! Ukraine and Iceland actually have very close bonds. Our cultures have been well acquainted with one another for over a thousand years. Our ancestors easily found a common language, and this can be traced now in both our and your language. We live in different parts of Europe, in different conditions - natural, economic, and security. But we value the same things - in Kaenugardi and in Reykjavik. Undoubtedly, freedom. The land we rightfully own. And our own culture, which not only shows our identity, separating us from neighboring nations, but also maintains for us and our children a connection with all previous generations. All this in Ukraine is under Russian attack. What will be left of Ukraine if Russia succeeds in its war against our state? The Russian occupiers bring a tyranny that does not allow any freedom. They want to appropriate our land. They have been saying for a long time that Ukraine allegedly has no right to exist independently. And they want to erase any mention of our culture. Despite the fact that our culture has more than 1000-year-old roots! I know how people live in your country. What is remembered the most is your ability to organize social life in an objectively difficult and demanding natural environment so that happiness is felt, so that there is sufficient security for ordinary people, and so that a true democracy works. When we see your cities, your communities, your people, we see just that - how freedom works, how culture works. And what a good result they give on earth. In our part of Europe, natural conditions are objectively easier. More sun, probably more opportunities for agriculture, easier opportunities for contacts between people. We are not threatened by ocean storms and volcanic eruptions. It seems that nature itself here in Ukraine and in the neighboring countries tried to help people. But look at the full-scale war that is going on in our land. Take a look at what the Russian troops are doing. Even in such comfortable conditions, they managed to create hell. For what? This is all outright. For us to never have democracy. So that we never have independence. So that our land, our nature can be used against our interests. So that our resources work for another state. And so that our people are just a silent workforce. Please pay attention to one illustrative fact: more than 500,000 of our people have already been deported to Russia. They were forced to go there. Everything was taken away from them: documents, means of communication. They are sent to remote regions of foreign lands, remote regions of Russia. There is an attempt to assimilate them there. By force! 500,000 deported people. This is a large number. You know that - this is more than the total population of your beautiful country. Extraordinary scale of horror! I'm sure you know about the murder of tens of thousands of residents of our city of Mariupol by the Russian occupiers. I am sure you have heard about the war crimes that the Russian army is committing against our civilians, particularly in our city of Bucha. Wherever the occupiers come in Ukraine, they immediately start looking for everyone who worked for our state. Who served in our army. They are looking for journalists, they are looking for activists. They capture representatives of local self-government. That is, all those who can fight for freedom. On their land, on our land. In order to live freely, as people want, as our people want. Ladies and Gentlemen! It is obvious that Russia's war against Ukraine is not just an attempt to seize one country and destroy life in it. No! This is an encroachment on freedom as such. That is why it is important for all free people of the world that our country is not left alone in the confrontation with Russia. It is important that every nation helps. I am grateful to your people for the steps you have already taken, in particular by supporting sanctions against the Russian Federation. I am also grateful for the support you provide to our country at various levels. But I urge you not to stop. I call on your government, your diplomats and your people to advocate for increasing pressure on Russia. To be advocates of freedom. In all directions. No trade with tyranny. Above all, it is necessary to abandon Russian oil, oil blends and petroleum products. No financial ties with tyranny. No political help for tyranny. It doesn't matter if the country is big or small. When we defend freedom, the contribution of absolutely everyone matters. We in Ukraine definitely believe in victory. We are doing everything to drive out the invaders and liberate our land and our people. I can't tell the date when this will happen. But we are already preparing for the reconstruction of our country. And to ensure a truly free and comfortable life, to guarantee the well-being of our people, we invite our friends and only friends to participate with us in the implementation of Ukraine's reconstruction program. I invite your country, your companies to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular in the energy modernization of our state. So that your energy efficiency experience also helps us, our people. I am sure we will be able to start this work soon. But first we will defend freedom. Our common freedom. We will do it.

0,"Dear guests, dear friends! I am grateful for this opportunity to participate in this discussion. I am also grateful that Chatham House, one of the most influential think tanks in Europe, set up a special program back in 2015 for independent and in-depth research into the Ukrainian context. This research helps find answers to the most pressing questions. And these are the questions I would like to ask today. I know you will ask me questions, there will be a dialogue. But I am sure that each and every one of you is well aware of the level of the problems that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought. This is the highest priority for us and, I am sure, for the whole world today. It has brought problems not only to our people, but to everyone on the continent and to everyone in the world. I am absolutely sure of that. This is a full-scale invasion - one that Europe has seen only in the worst times of the 20th century. I would like to briefly outline some of the challenges. The first is the extreme brutality of the Russian army and its people who came here, and the Russian state's extreme contempt for all international conventions, the entire system of international law, human rights - for me, this is the most important thing, the inviolability of borders, the integrity of states in Europe. Why is Russia doing all this? Because they think that if they can be held responsible for such crimes, criminal actions, it will be decades later. They simply do not believe that the international community can hold those responsible for the war crimes to justice as they are hiding behind the nuclear force. The second challenge is, in fact, nuclear blackmail. For the first time in many decades. Absolutely outright. Russian state propagandists on their media resources calculate how long it takes for nuclear missiles to hit European capitals. They talk about it publicly, openly. They tell how to detonate nuclear explosives in the ocean to wash away everything in the British Isles with a radioactive wave. They prepare infographics, that is, they are serious about it. They boast that Russia can destroy any state leaving only ""nuclear ashes"". Moreover, ""nuclear ashes"" is their quote, which they repeat as a mantra. Why is this happening? This is a feeling of impunity, and we are sure of it. They are accustomed to the fact that business ""as usual"" has always returned to the relations of all states with Russia. And even now there are politicians in Europe who are not ashamed of ties with the Russian state after all that the Russian army has done in Ukraine. The third challenge is that the world is a few steps away from political chaos in dozens of countries, which could be the result of food and inflation crises. By blackmailing Europe into launching the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline last year, Russia has provoked a price crisis in Europe. Gazprom deliberately did not supply the market with the necessary amount of gas to cover the deficit, and as a result, gas prices in Europe reached a historic maximum. This has affected all Europeans without exception. Now, as part of a full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia is blocking our ports it has seized. What does this lead to? The global market is left without sufficient supplies of some key products from Ukraine. This is what we have, what is the priority for the world - grain, sunflower oil, corn, other agricultural products. What consequences do we see? I'm sure we don't see everything. Because there is not much analytics here. I think we will see all this in the future. In some countries there is a shortage of sunflower oil. In other countries, the chains of agricultural production connected with our supplies are slowing down. In other countries, a shortage of basic food products is expected. All this together puts pressure on prices. In North Africa, the Middle East, Asia. And then it will affect other regions of the world. And the poorest will suffer. Who always suffers? The poorest. We are sure that the middle class will also suffer. Obviously, the political consequences of this can be dangerous. That is why I say that food security is one of the components of political chaos. Dear attendees! Russia's war against our state, which at first seemed only a bilateral event to many, some even smiled, some said it was just a conflict, Russia says it is a military operation. Now we all evaluate it differently, more seriously. But today is already the 72nd day of a full-scale war, and we do not yet see its end. We do not see or feel the willingness of the Russian side. Just as we do not see comprehensive answers to all the threats posed by Russia. What do we offer? There has not been a day since February 24 when I and our entire team did not negotiate to obtain the necessary weapons. To agree on the necessary sanctions against Russia. To organize the necessary cooperation to document and investigate war crimes. There has not been a day since the beginning of the brutal blockade of Mariupol by the Russian army, this is one of the examples, when we did not try to find a diplomatic solution to rescue people and organize humanitarian corridors for this rescue. We are in contact with everyone who can provide financial support to Ukraine. We have already started preparing a large-scale Recovery Plan for Ukraine, as we have no doubt that we will be able to defend our independence. And we believe in this strength of the world, in our strength. This is not a belief in a miracle. Common sense tells us that the world's response to the aggressor's actions, which Russia is now allowing itself, must be immediate. And what’s the reality? We've been talking about the same things for months. For example, the oil embargo against Russia, the blocking of the entire banking sector of the terrorist state. For months we have been fighting for a sufficient supply of weapons. And I am grateful to those states that help us from the first days constantly, every day. Because they correctly assessed the threat. But, unfortunately, not all states have assessed it that way. Even now, not everyone evaluates it that way. Most of Russia-provoked challenges and threats have not been fully addressed. That's the main thing. So, we need new tools, we need to look for them constantly. New determination. Something that can stop not only Russia, but also any potential aggressor. Ukraine proposes to create just such a tool. We call it U24. United 24. By upgrading the global security system, we must create opportunities to prevent any aggression or at least stop it in 24 hours. Or - in 24 hours to provide such assistance to the victim of aggression, which will restore peace. Or - if it is not a war, but a natural disaster or any social challenge - in 24 hours the world community must provide a country or region with all the necessary assistance to save people. With such a global response system, we will be able to ensure that millions of people are never again threatened with physical destruction. Or threats of deportation. Or - famine, destruction. Therefore, here are the specific questions that need to be answered by politicians, experts and society. And the questions I want to ask you now. What exactly can be done to ensure that the responsibility for war crimes is inevitable and comes not after a decade but faster, as in ordinary criminal proceedings? What specific sanctions against Russia can convince Russia, first of all, and all other potential aggressors in the world that international law must be respected? What specific global decisions are needed to keep the weapons of mass destruction in the world under control and to prevent their use and relevant blackmail? Even talks about it. And what sanctions should be imposed for nuclear blackmail or blackmail with chemical weapons? And what will convince the world's politicians that these issues are urgent and practical, and not just for discussion? I hope you will offer your thoughts, answers to these questions. This is your experience. Because objectively, we all need answers, the world needs them. I am sure that every person who watches us now and who asks himself or herself these questions every day needs the answers. And I'm sure that the U24 tool we offer can be an important part of your answers. This is an option. We are talking about this, about our initiative. Because I believe that the more initiatives there are, the more people understand the global nature of these challenges, the global nature of these responses. Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! Usually I address Ukrainians at this time and in the same way every night, when I summarize the events of the passing day. Every night - from the first day of this full-scale war of Russia against our state of Ukraine. Every night I report to the public on what has been done to protect the state. On what the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to achieve. On how we help our people. And on what international negotiations took place. For example, today one of the notable news was the news of my conversation with you, Boris. Every time such negotiations take place, it is important for my country, for Ukraine. And no less important, I'm sure, for Britain. Because it is about steadfastness, courage and about the leadership that we demonstrate together - the Ukrainian and British nations. In defense of freedom. Our common freedom. Russian troops today, as every day during this war, have continued to bomb our cities and our people. For example, my traditional morning meeting with the military, with the leadership of the army, with government officials and diplomats was accompanied by the sound of an air-raid siren. This is our reality. Missile strikes every day. The day before yesterday - on the day when you, Boris, addressed our parliament, the Russian army launched 15 missile strikes at Ukraine. And this can be called a certain ""Russian compliment"" to your brilliant speech and our fruitful interstate cooperation. Because yesterday there were only 7 such strikes. Obviously, Russia is annoyed by our proximity - Ukraine and Britain. So this means that we are really strong in defending freedom in Europe. In general, during this war, the Russian army has used 2014 missiles against Ukraine already. 2682 appearances of Russian fighter jets in our skies have been recorded. Each of these ""arrivals"" is the death of our people, the destruction of our infrastructure. If we take only the medical infrastructure, to date, Russian troops have destroyed or damaged almost 400 health facilities. These are hospitals, maternity hospitals, outpatient clinics. In the temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine - in the east and south - the situation with access to medical services and medicines is just catastrophic. Even the simplest medications are missing. Russia has brought to Ukraine and Europe such problems that we could not have imagined a few months ago. This is in fact a complete lack of treatment for cancer patients. This is an extremely difficult or impossible access to insulin for diabetics. It's the inability to perform surgery... It's just a lack of antibiotics! These are the consequences of the Russian occupation for a part of our land, for a part of our people, which we must liberate from the invaders. And we will definitely do it. In particular, due to your support. Today the rescue operation from Mariupol was continued. With the assistance of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. People are on their way to safe territory. More than 150 people from Azovstal and more than 300 people from Mariupol and its suburbs who were evacuated by the humanitarian corridor this week are already receiving all the help they need. Medical, document renewal, financial assistance, communication with relatives, friends and families. Currently, Russian shelling and assault of Azovstal do not stop. But civilians still need to be taken out - women, children. Many children who are still there. Just imagine this hell! And there are children! More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death nearby... We expect an effective regime of silence. We are doing everything to find a solution to save our military. Heroes who defend Mariupol against the occupiers prevailing in the number of troops. There are different units there. They have many wounded. But they do not give up. They are holding positions. We do not give up either. Every day, the whole team is looking for an option that will ensure the safety of these people. And I am grateful to everyone who helps. To all those who offered mediation and are making efforts to save Ukrainians. Today I addressed the participants of the high-level donors' conference held in Warsaw. It is also an element of our protection, an element of protection for the whole of Europe. Because it is not only on the battlefield that the fate of our state and the future of the continent is being decided now. But also in the economic field, in the field of readiness of world leaders to unite to rebuild Ukraine after this war and give stability and security to the center and east of Europe. We have the result. It has been announced that $ 6.5 billion has been raised at this conference. And this is good. But this is only part of what is really needed to restore normal life throughout the territory where Russia has brought the war. That is why we need a modern analogue of the Marshall Plan for Ukraine. Stronger participation of the free world and international institutions is needed. I spoke about this today at the conference. However, we call for the cooperation and support of each and everyone. Everyone for whom freedom matters. That is why United24 was launched today - a global initiative that will unite people from all over the world around the desire to help Ukraine. And I invite you to join this initiative! The initial component is a platform of the same name to raise funds to support our struggle. United24. Its main goal is to increase donations to Ukraine. Just a few clicks - and everyone can join the direction that they find most useful right now and for themselves. Because Ukraine needs up to $ 7 billion a month to cover the state budget deficit. In total, it has been calculated that already more than $ 600 billion is needed to rebuild what the Russian army destroyed. Just imagine this scale! That is why every manifestation of support, every sincere help to Ukraine is important. In particular, yours today. Ladies and Gentlemen!  Friends! If everyone in the world - or at least the vast majority - were steadfast and courageous leaders as Ukraine, as Britain, I am sure we would have already ended this war and restored peace throughout our liberated territory for all our people. But we still have to fight. Fight. As you, Boris, said, addressing our Verkhovna Rada the day before yesterday, we are still writing one of the most victorious chapters in our history. And now we can assess the significance of this chapter, in particular, by the following fact: 11,672 of our defenders have already been awarded state awards for courage and effective defense of Ukraine. In a little over ten weeks. 11,672 people. And a few minutes before this address, I signed a decree awarding another 286 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It is on the shoulders of these brave warriors and their brothers-in-arms that Ukraine and, to be honest, the whole of Europe are now standing. And I thank you for your really effective support of this struggle. Bravery is rightly believed the first of human qualities as it guarantees all others. Thank you, Britain! Thank you, Boris!  Thank you all! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen! After ten weeks of the full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, our meeting in this format and for this purpose proves that Ukraine, Europe and the whole free world are on the way to a common victory. Our state retains full functionality. Our continent is united. Millions and millions of people around the world support us to make tyranny lose. The Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our heroic defenders bravely and firmly defend freedom on the battlefield. But how this brutal war will end is decided not only on the battlefield. But also in the aspects of economy, finance, humanitarian support, the ability to ensure a normal life in the territory free from the enemy, in rebuilding what was destroyed by the Russian army. Freedom must demonstrate that it protects and provides for people better than tyranny, which has enjoyed a massive flow of money for oil, gas and other raw materials for decades. That's how freedom will win. That is why this conference is important for everyone in Europe. Both strategically and tactically important. First. Sufficient financial resources are needed so that Ukrainian men and women are provided with everything they need while the war continues. The Ukrainian state, as the administrator of these funds, will ensure all urgent needs - both defensive and social and humanitarian. Second. We are already preparing a large-scale Recovery Plan for Ukraine after the war and need a strategic international support plan for Ukraine that will be a modern analogue of the historic Marshall Plan. It is money, technology, expertise and growth opportunities that are needed to return to a secure life, to modernization and to social development. It will be an investment in the stability of the whole of central and eastern Europe. So that the aggressor knows that it will not break the power of Europe and all free nations. And so that everything destroyed by the war is rebuilt at a high level. The reconstruction of Ukraine must now become the same historical example for our time and for the future as the restoration of European countries after World War II. And such free world’s investments, if they are fast, if they are sufficient, will mean that millions of our people who became IDPs because of this war will be able to return home. We offer our partners - civilized and responsible states - to take patronage over those regions, over those cities, over those industries of Ukraine that have suffered from the war waged by Russia. Take patronage to work with us to rebuild these regions, our cities, towns and industries. Such a patronage project can create a new and equally historic example of interaction and partnership between the free world, between the regions, cities and companies of Europe and democratic countries. Third. Ukraine’s quick movement to the European Union is needed through its candidate status, which must be granted right now - in conditions of war. As part of a special shortened procedure for EU membership. Because this war of Russia against Ukraine was planned as a prelude to a strike at a united Europe. Greater unification is a powerful answer. That is why Ukraine's membership in the European Union must be an absolute reality. Not just promises, not just prospects, but practical steps. I know we are ready for these steps. And you know it, too. And I am sure that most of you, European leaders, are also ready for this. Ladies and Gentlemen! I am very grateful to Poland and Sweden, to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson for organizing this important high-level donor conference. I am very grateful to President of the European Council Charles Michel and to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for their leadership, which makes Europe a true defender of the most important thing - freedom. I am grateful to all the participants of the Conference for being with us in this war for a free and democratic life for millions of people. Not only for Ukraine. But for all of us who may be threatened by tyranny. I believe that Europe will show its strength today. You will show your strength. In particular, international institutions - UN institutions, whose representatives are here with us now and can be even more effective. Because this is for our common freedom. Thank you for your attention. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Today I will start with a story about one person. About Oleksandr Makhov - a well-known journalist. I'm sure you've seen his reports on Ukraine and Dom TV channels. You may have seen his comments, his posts. He has always been like that - with his own position. Patriotic and sincere. And always without vanity. And he was always among the bravest, among the first. He always worked in the hottest spots. Tried to bring true material. Powerful material. In 2017, he was the first Ukrainian journalist to visit our station in Antarctica. When COVID came, he was not afraid. He has lived in Sanzhary for two weeks, where Ukrainians were brought to from China. From the first day of the full-scale war, he was on the frontline. Volunteer. ATO veteran. Warrior of the 95th assault brigade. Born in the Luhansk region. He had a special feeling of what this war means. Today he died in the Kharkiv region, in the battles near Izium. He was 36 years old. My sincere condolences to relatives and friends. Let his son Vladyslav know: Russia will bear responsibility for this death. We will definitely gain victory for Ukraine. I'm sure it was Oleksandr's dream. And we will make it come true. Eternal memory to him and to all our heroes who gave lives for Ukraine! The second stage of our evacuation operation from Mariupol was completed today. 344 people were rescued - from the city and its suburbs. That's how many people departed to Zaporizhzhia today. Our team is getting ready to meet them. Meet in the same way as more than 150 people whom we managed to take out of Azovstal. They all receive the necessary help. All of them will receive the most caring treatment from our state. I am grateful to all those who make the evacuation operation successful: Iryna Vereshchuk, Andriy Yermak, David Arakhamia, UN representatives, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and everyone who reached an agreement and provided silence and corridors for the people. We are negotiating and hope to continue rescuing people from Azovstal, from Mariupol. There are still civilians. Women, children. To save them, we need to continue the silence. The Ukrainian side is ready to provide it. It takes time to just lift people out of those basements, out of those underground shelters. In the current conditions, we cannot use special equipment to clear the debris. Everything is done manually. But we believe that everything will work out. I spoke today with UN Secretary-General António Guterres. About what has already happened. What we still have to do to save Mariupol residents and defenders of the city. There was not a day when I didn't do it, when we didn't do it. And I am grateful to everyone who helps. I spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Bennett. I congratulated him on the Independence Day of the State of Israel. We talked about the situation in the east of our country and especially in Mariupol. We also discussed the scandalous and completely unacceptable statements of the Russian Foreign Minister, which outraged the whole world. I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. We agreed on the next diplomatic steps needed for peace. We discussed how to bring to justice all war criminals. Every Russian soldier and every commander who killed, tortured and tormented our people. Today, the Russian invaders launched another missile strike at our cities. At Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia. At the cities of Donbas and other regions of our country. All these crimes will get proper answers. Both legal and quite practical - on the battlefield. I addressed the people of Denmark today on the occasion of Liberation Day. The Nazis were expelled from this country 77 years ago. Every year in May, all Europeans, all decent people on earth recall this feat - victory over the worst evil in human history. Victory in the war against Nazism. But to recall means not just to remember. This means remembering and really trying to never allow what the Nazis did to Europe again. It is the Ukrainians, together with our friends and partners - the anti-war coalition, as the anti-Hitler once was - that are repelling those who have forgotten exactly why people rejoiced in 1945. Because if everyone in Russia really remembered, this war simply would not have started now. Traditionally, before delivering the evening address, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 35 servicemen of the 19th missile brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. I am grateful to all our heroes! To all who stood up for our state. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear friends! Danish people! Today you celebrate the anniversary of the day that was a dream. It has long been a dream of freedom and peace. This dream has become a reality. Five years. It was on this day that the five long years of Nazi occupation of your country came to an end. They lost. And freedom won. Life won. Denmark and the whole world then celebrated and hoped that such a brutal war would be the last and that no one would want to destroy peace anymore. They hoped that there would be no more feeling of mortal danger. That people can get rid of military habits. They hoped to forget forever about the light masking that was required. They hoped that air-raid sirens would no longer sound to report the real threat. That they can be turned on only once a year to remember the war that took place. But the war came again. It is here and now. It is in Ukraine. And it is not going to stop on our land. And it has already become as brutal as that war, the victory in which we all remember every year in May. I remember addressing you and the Folketing on the 34th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. I said then that Russia used 1370 missiles against our country. Today - already 1993 missiles. Just imagine how many lives they took. Most of them hit non-military targets. Then, on March 29, I told you that the Russian occupiers had destroyed 773 educational facilities in our country. And today - twice as much. 1584. These are kindergartens, schools, universities. This is what the Russian army is fighting against in Ukraine. The invaders have already killed 220 Ukrainian children. And we do not yet know for sure the situation in the occupied territories. But when I spoke to you last time, there were 144 names on the list of children killed. You see these terrible numbers grow. There were 144. Now - 220 children killed! They did not even have time to feel what life is like. The Russian state is not yet ready to stop the war. They still dream of capturing Ukraine and other European countries. They still dream that freedom in Europe must disappear. But their dreams must not come true. The dream of peace must come true. Our and your dream. Just like it was 77 years ago. Right now in Ukraine it is being decided how people will live on our continent. Whether there will be peace. Not only for us, but also for our neighbors, for you and us. Evil does not know what state borders are. Tyranny never stops at capturing just one country. You are already helping us fight. We are grateful to you. Fight with weapons, with your ""yes"" vote for our accession to the European Union, with honesty in the issue of sanctions and with sincerity towards our people. The sea of Ukrainian flags here today, the sea of flags on the streets of your cities shows that you understand everything. No one will now say how many more days this war, unleashed by the Russian Federation, will last. But I believe that our Liberation Day is approaching. I believe that just as I am addressing your people now, when you celebrate the anniversary of the liberation of your country, your representatives will address the Ukrainian people as we celebrate the anniversary of our peace. Now, as every year, you light candles across the country in memory of that war and victory over evil. And I ask you, when you see the warm light of candles, remember, please, about Ukrainian children. About those 220 children whose lives were taken by this war. Remember that Europe can do its best to keep this horrible list of children killed from growing. Never again. I am grateful to each and every one of you! Thank you, Denmark! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"I wish you health, Ukrainians! Our defenders! We finally have the result, the first result of our evacuation operation from Azovstal in Mariupol, which we have been organizing for a very long time. It took a lot of effort, long negotiations and various mediations. Today 156 people arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Women and children. They have been in shelters for more than two months. Just imagine! For example, a child is six months old, two of which are underground, fleeing bombs and shelling. Finally, these people are completely safe. They will get help. And I am grateful to all those on whom the rescue of these people depended. Who agreed and who helped. I am grateful to everyone who ensured the physical transportation of people through the humanitarian corridor. Of course, we will continue to do everything to get all our people out of Mariupol and Azovstal. It's difficult. But we need everyone who stays there: civilians and military. There was not a day when we did not address this issue, when our people did not try to solve this issue. Yes, we managed to achieve a ceasefire for almost three days in order to make the humanitarian corridor work. Currently, Russian troops are not adhering to the agreements. They continue massive strikes at Azovstal. They are trying to storm the complex. But I have been told many times that no one can be saved. That it is impossible. And today 156 people are in Zaporizhzhia. This is not a victory yet, but this is already a result. And I believe that there is a chance to save our other people. Apparently, the Russian military has reacted extremely nervously to our success today. Various Ukrainian cities have once again become targets for Russian missiles and Russian strikes. Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Odesa, Kharkiv region - such a scale of today's shelling clearly does not indicate that Russia has any special military purpose. Strike at Zakarpattia? What exactly can it give Russia? They are trying to vent their powerlessness. Because they can't beat Ukraine. But they can - so far - burn children's attractions in Gorky Park in Kharkiv or destroy a bridge. Or a grain warehouse or a house with people. The more such strikes, the farther Russia is from civilization. From what is called civilizedness. Today we also have another tragic news. A terrible road accident took place in the Rivne region. A bus, a car and a fuel truck collided. As of this time, 17 people died. But there may be more casualties. My sincere condolences to all those who lost their loved ones. I commissioned to provide all the necessary assistance to the victims. I am grateful to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the great friend of Ukraine, Boris Johnson, for his support of Ukraine and our defenders. Today Boris addressed our parliament and our people. These were very important words, warm, friendly, powerful. This is a very sincere gesture. I am also grateful to Britain for the new package of support for our country, which the Prime Minister announced today. I also addressed the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine today. For the first time during a full-scale war. I emphasized the main thing - and the main thing not only for me, but also for the whole of Ukraine. I am sure we must maintain maximum unity. Because our success depends on unity. Not only political success, but also the defense of the state, the strength of our people, our society. I continued the very useful practice of addressing the parliaments of our partner countries. Today (addressed - ed.) the Parliament and the people of Albania. Thanked for the support, including defensive support. Noted the cordiality with which the people of Albania support our people. Other such addresses are also planned. I also spoke with representatives of the largest global companies - in the CEO Wall Street Journal club (this is a very influential club. Three trillion dollars is the total turnover of companies whose leaders are in this club). About how to put pressure on Russia to end the war. About how to rebuild Ukraine after the war together. About what the post-war model of the Ukrainian economy can be. I believe that such economic diplomacy is one of our most important tasks. I spoke today with Polish President Andrzej Duda. I congratulated him and the entire Polish people on the national holiday - the Constitution Day of Poland. We discussed further cooperation, concrete steps and support for our defense. I informed him about the current situation in the areas of hostilities. About what is happening in Mariupol. About the evacuation of Ukrainians. And about what else we can do together to help protect our state and our common freedom - freedom of Ukrainians and Poles, all Europeans. Traditionally, before delivering the address, I signed decrees awarding our heroes. 185 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, two of them posthumously. Two more of our defenders were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our state! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies! The people of Albania! Yesterday, Muslims around the world celebrated Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting for Islam. And I congratulate you on this holiday. I wish you what all Ukrainian men and women wish for each other - peace. During this month, the Muslims of Ukraine and our entire society have not seen a single calm and peaceful day. That's how we live after February 24. Exactly like that. Russia has turned all our days into a mortal danger. Yesterday, a 14-year-old boy died as a result of a missile attack on our Odesa, our southern city. A 17-year-old girl was also wounded. Every day we have such a reality. Every day Ukrainians lose children because of Russian strikes. And more than 600 children have fallen victim to this Russian invasion. 220 children were killed and 406 were injured. Today is a farewell ceremony for journalist Vira Gyrych who was killed by a Russian missile at her home in the capital of our state, Kyiv. The missile hit her house. An ordinary multi-storey building near the downtown of the capital. The Russian army is firing at our cities and villages with artillery and aircraft. Does not spare missiles. In our largest city in the east of the country, in the city of Kharkiv, a fifth of all houses was destroyed. This is more than two and a half thousand houses. They were burned, destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling. Once one of the most developed cities on the shore of the Sea of Azov - the city of Mariupol - is completely destroyed. There are no undamaged buildings. None, imagine! This half-million city has been under siege by the Russian army since early March. They didn’t allow water, food, medicine - nothing and no one. And they didn’t stop bombing it. This is literally a scorched city. But you can take any Ukrainian city or village where the occupiers came and there will be very similar messages. About destruction and about murders. About tortures. About forced deportation of people to Russia. About total looting of everything on our territory. Older people who survived two occupations - the Nazi occupation during World War II and now the occupation by the Russian army - say they did not see such atrocities 80 years ago. Now they saw the Russian military shooting children in the face. Now they saw ordinary people - peasants who had been taken prisoner - being forced to lie on the ground day and night in sub-zero temperatures. It turns out that the Russian troops have a special method of ""fighting"" the escape of prisoners in the cold season: they are forced to pour water into their shoes, put the shoes on and lie on the ground in the cold. People stopped feeling their feet, their toes froze. But the occupiers did not even allow them to stand up, let alone to warm up. In the areas liberated from the Russian army, we constantly find graves of tortured people. They have their hands tied, traces of shots on their arms and legs, and broken ribs. Many were shot in the back of the head. Often the occupiers did not even allow the bodies of those killed to be buried. Bodies are found in forests, fields, basements, wells. Retreating from our land, the Russian army left the dead just on the streets as well. Russia was offered to cease fire at least on Orthodox Easter. There was no answer. It was also offered on Pesach - there was no answer. Russia has also ignored the sanctity of the month of Ramadan. Just think about it: 86 religious sites were destroyed or damaged by shelling. These are churches, mosques, houses of worship. The Russian army is not trying to protect even the facilities of the Russian church from its shelling! This is a complete abandonment of morality. Complete rejection of universal values. Complete non-recognition of life as an unconditional value. And they do not want to stop in Ukraine. They want to go further. In an attempt to revive the worst-level tyranny seen in the twentieth century, Russia has become the greatest threat to the entire free world. And I am grateful to every nation that is fighting this tyranny with us. Because only if we stop Russia now in Ukraine will we be able to save Europe from the coming of a new era - the era of non-freedom. Save it from what your people had to go through, in particular. Ladies and Gentlemen! The people of Albania! I am grateful to you for not hesitating who to support in this struggle. You are definitely on the side of freedom and truth. Thank you for concrete steps for Ukraine. For defense assistance. For supporting sanctions on Russia. For taking care of our people and hosting our children, especially in Durrës. This attitude of yours towards Ukrainian men and women in difficult times reminds me of St. Mother Teresa. An Albanian woman whose life has become a symbol of humanism for everyone in the world. She taught people that good daily efforts can defeat evil and bring them closer to the holiness that people will remember from generation to generation. I believe that by working together with all Europeans in this way - by our daily good efforts, we will be able not only to stop this war waged by Russia, but also to protect Europe in the future from the recurrence of such a threat. As the sixth package of sanctions against Russia's aggression is being discussed in the European Union, we must all insist that it includes an oil embargo and a real blockade of any schemes that Russia uses to deceive the free world and ignore sanctions. Russian banks must be completely disconnected from the global financial system. However difficult it may be, it is necessary to deliberately restrict trade with the Russian Federation. Because if not today, then tomorrow Russia will consciously use trade ties to hit your market when it wants some political concessions from you. You need to deprive it of this tool in time. I ask you to close the ports for Russian ships. And limit the arrival of Russian tourists. Because you can never know who came to you... Maybe the killers who were in Bucha? Or maybe the tormentors of Mariupol? Or maybe someone who is already working to undermine your country? I am grateful to Albania for its cooperation within the United Nations platform. Especially now when your country is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. We need to do a principled thing and stop using UN funds to sponsor Russia. If it violates the UN Charter, threatens the world's food security and destroys peace in Europe, it has no right to receive a single cent from the UN. Since 2014, when Russia seized our Crimean peninsula and started the war in Donbas, the UN has purchased goods and services from it for at least two and a half billion dollars. This is simply unfair. Wrong. Decades ago, Ukraine and Albania chose the path of democracy and European integration. We did not deviate from this path. Together we are committed to the development of freedom and a united Europe. And I believe that when the time comes to decide on Ukraine's accession to the European Union, your vote will be able to sound in our support. I am sure that right now everyone in the world is showing their true character. Someone is big in size, but very small when you have to be bold. And someone is small on the map, but its cordiality is one of the greatest. Thank you, Albania! Thank you for your support. Thank you for your cordiality. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear people's deputies of Ukraine! Ladies and Gentlemen! First of all, I would like to thank the leader of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, and all the people of the United Kingdom. For the words we hear. For the actions we see. For the support we feel. For the help we actually receive. For the victory that we will definitely gain together! On October 8, 2020, our countries became strategic partners. And on February 24, 2022, we proved that our partnership is not on paper. Our partnership is on the battlefield. In the battles for common ideals, battles for a common future. It has been almost ten weeks since the Russian Federation declared full-scale war against them and invaded our beautiful Ukrainian land. During this time, Ukraine and Britain have gone a path from partners to friends and brothers. And the one who lied that he is a friend and a brother has gone a path from a neighbor to an occupier and a terrorist. Is it sad? Yes. Is it scary? No. Because these almost ten weeks have proved: it is not scary when such an evil enemy is against you if such a good friend is next to you. Such as Great Britain. And leader Boris Johnson. And these words are not flattery, not courtesy, they are reality. We are together. Almost every day. We are in touch. Daily. If we don't have a conversation today, it means only one thing: we are busy with what we agreed on yesterday. And it is so almost all these weeks, all this difficult time. For the sake of one goal, one moment - the first second of victory. And for the sake of one epoch - the epoch where peace reigns. In Ukraine, and therefore in Europe, and therefore in the world. I would like to thank the United Kingdom, which is bringing this moment closer with us and which is ready to guarantee our security. And this gratitude of mine is not a formality. Because I know that the guarantees of Great Britain will never be a formality for Ukraine. Because these almost ten weeks have proved that your word is solid and your actions are decisive. Without any ""almost"". I hate that word - ""almost"". As well as our interaction and support of British allies. First of all, it is a weapon and equipment for our military, which protects both Ukraine, Europe and the whole world from the Russian occupiers. I will not voice all the details to the public - let it be an unpleasant surprise for the aggressor every day. Instead, I can speak openly about all other forms of support. This is humanity. And help for our refugees and internally displaced persons. Medicines, food, ambulances and fire engines and other large humanitarian aid. This is justice. And assistance in the investigation of war crimes of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. This is resilience. Macro-financial assistance for our economy. This is the abolition of customs duties, the abolition of quotas for our bilateral trade. This is the reconstruction of our land, this is the reconstruction of Kyiv and the Kyiv region, which will be joined by Great Britain. These are important global things. Sanctions against the Russian Federation, energy embargo, asset blocking. These are ordinary, very simple human, but no less important, symbolic things. Blue and yellow flags on Trafalgar Square and Downing Street. When we are supported by London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, supported by Liverpool, Manchester and hundreds of other cities in this great state. When Ukraine is supported by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Sir Paul McCartney, Elton John and Sting. Richard Branson, Joanne Rowling, the Beckhams, Benedict Cumberbatch, Queen, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple. Ed Sheeran, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Daniel Radcliffe and, of course, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. It is also very important - the return of Melinda Simmons, and the recent visit of Prime Minister Johnson. At a very difficult time and at a very necessary moment. Our walk in the streets of Kyiv showed the world that the heart of Ukraine feels. Pain. But the people we met there, their words, their eyes, smiles and gifts - already famous roosters, the same as in Borodyanka - all this showed the world what our Ukrainian soul feels. Indomitability. Unbreakability. Therefore, hope for victory. Today, I, our parliament and the entire Ukrainian people can say one thing: thank you, Britain! Thank you, friends! Dear people's deputies of Ukraine! Please agree, when there is such unity in this hall, it is priceless! During these almost ten weeks, I have addressed the House of Commons, the US Congress, the European Parliament, the Bundestag, the Knesset, the Seimas, and many other parliamentarians and parliaments. But I did not address you. And this is not contempt, on the contrary - it is a great trust in you. You are here. And you know very well what is happening in our country. We are all citizens of this great state, and you know exactly what to do. I believe that has not changed in these almost ten weeks. I will be happy if the following becomes obvious and indisputable for you. You are the people's deputies of the greatest state in the modern world! I'm sure of it! You are the people's deputies of Ukraine. Keywords are ""people"" and ""Ukraine"". I think we will abandon trifles, political speculation until peacetime, although it is better to abandon them forever. The agenda of the Verkhovna Rada is obvious. The keyword is ""order"". Because there is no time for spam, quarrels and PR - everyone already knows you. I think wise rationalism and sound nationalism are important. All this is very important for us today. You are part of a large Ukrainian army. Your frontline is a legislative field in which you must work for our people, for each of us, for our state, for our victory. Like our army, like the whole country. Work 24/7. No days off, no unnecessary emotions, slogans, etc. Today we all have one party, and this party is Ukraine. One faction - Ukraine. One majority - Ukraine. One, strong, independent. And everything that does not help it or, God forbid, harms, weakens or splits, must be not in the minority, no. This must be a thing of the past. Just like someone's hopes of sitting out somewhere. Currently, the absence of a deputy is justified by only two things: his work abroad or in the regions for the interests of our state or his death for the interests of the state. The rest is of no interest to Ukraine today. It doesn't need anything else, it won't have anything else! Anything else follows the Russian warship! Please do not waste time on unnecessary laws. There are important priorities for the state. I know that you are professionals, you will do it. The state is waiting. Please do not waste your time, my time, the time of the people of Ukraine on minor initiatives and unimportant things. It seems to me that laws should be as timely as Lend-Lease. Accurate as our ""Stugna"" and ""Bayraktar"". And bring benefits like ""Neptune"". And glory like our army. And to be such that will go down in history like the people of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 68th day of our strong defense is coming to an end. The 68th day of self-destruction of Russia. Self-destruction in every sense of the word. If this country once had what is called a reputation, now Russia does things on a daily basis that simply preclude any adequacy. Yesterday, for example, Russia's foreign minister openly and without hesitation said that the biggest anti-Semites were allegedly among the Jews themselves. And that Hitler allegedly had Jewish blood. How could this be said on the eve of the anniversary of the victory over Nazism? These words mean that Russia's top diplomat is blaming the Jewish people for Nazi crimes. No words. Of course, there is a big scandal in Israel today as regards these words. However, no one hears objections or excuses from Moscow. There is silence. Hence, they agree with what their foreign minister said. After the Russian missile attack at Babyn Yar in Kyiv, after the Menorah damaged by shelling at the site of the mass executions in Drobytsky Yar near Kharkiv, after the deaths of ordinary people who survived the Nazi occupation and Nazi concentration camps from Russian shelling, such an anti-Semitic thrust by their minister means Russia has forgotten all the lessons of World War II. Or maybe they never studied those lessons. So the question is will the Israeli ambassador stay in Moscow knowing their new position? Will relations with Russia remain as usual? Because it's not accidental. The words of the Russian foreign minister - a ""great connoisseur of Hitlerism"" - are not accidental. It is no coincidence that the Russian occupiers are creating so-called ""filtration camps"" on Ukrainian land through which thousands of our Ukrainian citizens are passing. Where our people are killed, tortured and raped. It is no coincidence that the occupiers capture civilians and take them hostage or deport them as free labor. It is no coincidence that they are waging a so-called total war to destroy all living things, after which only the burned ruins of entire cities and villages remain. To do this, one must completely reject the moral and achievements of the victors of Nazism. But if such people are in the Russian leadership, it does not mean they can judge others in Europe or in the world according to themselves. If they send tens of thousands of their citizens to die in a foreign land and do not even take the bodies of those killed from the streets, roads, fields, it does not mean that everyone else is like them. If there are people among them who come from Ukraine but support the extermination of Ukrainians and everything Ukrainian, it does not mean that everyone else has abandoned normal human morality. Today, Russian troops launched another missile strike at Odesa. Destroyed the dormitory. A 14-year-old boy was killed. A 17-year-old girl was wounded, she has a shrapnel wound. What is it? For what? What did these children and the dormitory threaten the Russian state with? And that's how they fight. That's all. A gymnasium founded over a hundred years ago burned down in Lysychansk, Luhansk region, due to Russian shelling. It was built by the Belgians for this city. It withstood two world wars. But, as we see, this gymnasium turned out to be a terrible threat to modern Russia. 220 Ukrainian children have been killed by the Russian army since February 24. And we still don't know about everyone, because we don't have access to the temporarily occupied areas of our state. 1570 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged by shelling. It's in a little over two months! That is why the whole free world united so that no one justifies Nazism, kills children or destroys peaceful cities as Russia does. Today in Kyiv I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark. We discussed the whole range of issues of our bilateral relations, especially defense, financial and political cooperation. I see progress in implementing the agreements reached during the talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark. I am grateful. I received good signals. Plans to rebuild Ukraine after the war were also discussed. And support for our movement towards the European Union. I am grateful that Denmark resumes the work of its embassy in our capital. This is already the 29th foreign mission that returned to Ukraine. We are working on new sanctions against Russia. We expect a new package from the European Union in the near future. This package should include clear steps to block Russia's energy revenues. We truly believe in this. So that the terrorist state is not given a billion euros a day for fuel. But it is also worth preparing for the next sanctions steps now. In any case, we will have to block all export-import operations with Russia. Because that's what they make money on in Moscow. And they do not even understand that international law and peace in Europe must be respected. We continue to do everything to save our people from Mariupol. The evacuation operation continues. Tomorrow we also expect movement through humanitarian corridors from Berdyansk, Tokmak, Vasylivka. The Armed Forces of Ukraine heroically repel the occupiers' attempts to advance. Kharkiv direction, Donbas, the south of the country - everywhere the situation remains extremely difficult. But I am grateful to each and every one of our defenders who are holding the defense. I have just signed a large decree to award our military. 438 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Ruslanovych Todorov for his personal courage and extraordinary efficiency in the battles against the occupiers in the Donetsk region. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today we finally managed to start the evacuation of people from Azovstal. After many weeks of negotiations, after many attempts, different meetings, people, calls, countries, proposals. Finally! There was not a single day when we did not try to find a solution that would save our people. Today, for the first time in all the days of the war, this vital corridor has started working. For the first time there were two days of real ceasefire on this territory. More than a hundred civilians have already been evacuated - women and children first of all. Who were fleeing hostilities there. At Azovstal.  Given all the complexities of the process, the first evacuees will arrive in Zaporizhzhia tomorrow morning. Hopefully this doesn’t fail. Our team will meet them there. I hope that tomorrow all the necessary conditions will be met to continue the evacuation of people from Mariupol. We plan to start at 8 am. I am also grateful to all those who participated in the preparation of the rescue of people and who ensure this humanitarian corridor. I am grateful to everyone who held negotiations. To Iryna Vereshchuk as the coordinator of this process. I am grateful to our intelligence. Our team - David, Andriy. And also to the partners who joined and managed to help. In particular, from the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross. We will continue to do everything to evacuate our people from Azovstal, from Mariupol in general. The organization of such humanitarian corridors is one of the elements of the ongoing negotiation process. It is very complex. But no matter how difficult it was, more than 350,000 people were rescued from the areas of hostilities. I discussed key issues of assistance to our state with Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi who visited Kyiv together with a US Congress delegation. We are grateful to all partners who convey such important and powerful signals of support for Ukraine to the world and to Russia by visiting our capital in these conditions and at such a difficult time. I thanked for the revival of the historic Lend-Lease program, which once helped protect freedom in Europe and can certainly do so a second time. We discussed specific areas - how Lend-Lease can work to strengthen our state as much as possible and help in the struggle for freedom. I also thanked for the preparation of a large package of aid to Ukraine worth 33 billion US dollars. We discussed how we can strengthen sanctions on Russia in a way that most effectively encourages it to end the war and limits Russia's ability to circumvent existing and future sanctions. I felt the support of our initiatives. Today, Russian troops continued to strike at the territory of our state. The targets they choose prove once again that the war against Ukraine is a war of extermination for the Russian army. They targeted the warehouses of agricultural enterprises. The grain warehouse was destroyed. The warehouse with fertilizers was also shelled. They continued shelling of residential neighborhoods in the Kharkiv region, Donbas, etc. They are accumulating forces in the south of the country to try to attack our cities and communities in the Dnipropetrovsk region. What could be Russia's strategic success in this war? Honestly, I do not know. The ruined lives of people and the burned or stolen property will give nothing to Russia. It will only increase the toxicity of the Russian state and the number of those in the world who will work to isolate Russia. The Armed Forces of Ukraine respond to all the attacks of the invaders. And they will continue to respond until the occupiers leave our land. I am grateful to all our defenders. To everyone who has been defending the state since February 24 and since 2014. In just 67 days of the full-scale war, 143 our warriors have already been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. More than 10,600 defenders have been awarded state awards of Ukraine.

0,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! Today we marked the Border Guard Day. It is clear that there can be no celebrations during the war. But it is necessary to support Ukrainian men and women who defend the state in the ranks of the Border Guard Service. Since the first days of the war - and not only since February 24, but also since 2014 - border guards have been bravely defending Ukraine. They fulfill combat missions. They were the first to face the Russian invaders at the state border. They are under daily shelling. They are fighting side by side with the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with our National Guard, with the National Police, with the territorial defense and all those who stood up for our state. In particular, they are fighting in Mariupol, heroically defending our city. 340 border guards - our heroes. I talked to them today. Congratulated them. Thanked them. I am grateful to everyone whose professional day was today. I had the honor to present state awards to border guards who distinguished themselves in the battles for our state. The occupiers are accumulating additional forces for new attacks against our military in the east of the country. They built up reinforcements in the Kharkiv region, trying to increase pressure in Donbas. They have already lost more than 23,000 soldiers in the battles of this senseless war for Russia. But they do not stop. We know that the Russian command is preparing for new big losses. In those units, the personnel of which was almost completely destroyed or significantly weakened in March-April, new people are being recruited. With little motivation. With little combat experience. They just want to get the right amount. So that they can throw these units into the offensive. The Russian command is well aware that thousands more Russian soldiers will be killed and thousands more will be wounded in the coming weeks. But why do the Russian soldiers themselves need this? Why do their families need this? Russian commanders lie to their soldiers saying they will face some serious responsibility for refusing to fight. And at the same time they do not tell, for example, about the preparation by the Russian army of additional refrigerators for storing corpses. They do not tell what new ""planned"" losses the generals expect. Every Russian soldier can still save his life. You'd better survive in Russia than die on our land. Our defenders have already destroyed more than a thousand Russian tanks. Almost two hundred Russian aircraft. Almost two and a half thousand armored fighting vehicles. Of course, the occupiers still have equipment in stock. Yes, they still have missiles to strike at our territory. But this war has already weakened Russia so much that they have to plan even fewer military equipment for the parade in Moscow. We are actively communicating with partners to enhance sanctions on Russia. For Mariupol, for all the destroyed cities and communities of Ukraine, for war crimes against our people. For missile and air strikes at the territory of Ukraine. Today the occupiers again fired missiles at the Dnipropetrovsk region and Odesa. Again and again, Russian troops prove that the people of Odesa are the same enemies for Russia as all other Ukrainians. The runway of the Odesa airport was destroyed. We will, of course, rebuild it. But Odesa will never forget such a Russian attitude towards it. We expect a decision on oil restrictions against Russia in the near future. We insist that a fair part of sanctions against Russian oil should be the blocking of any attempts by Russia to circumvent restrictions through the sale of so-called oil blends. If any company or state helps Russia trade oil, it must also face sanctions. Any sponsorship in the interests of the Russian military terrorist machine must end. I spoke today with President of France Emmanuel Macron. On various areas of cooperation between Ukraine and France, especially on defense. Also - on cooperation on Ukraine's path to the European Union. We are moving towards the political formalization of what is already a fact: Ukraine has become an integral part of a united Europe. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. On defense support for Ukraine and other efforts necessary to end the war. I informed Boris about the current situation on the battlefield in the areas of active clashes and in detail about the situation in our east, in Mariupol, in the south of the country. All the leaders of the free world know what Russia has done to Mariupol. And Russia will not go unpunished for this. Many of the leaders are trying to help save our heroic defenders of the city. This was discussed in great detail with the UN Secretary-General during his visit to Kyiv. We are doing everything to ensure that the evacuation mission from Mariupol is carried out. I held talks with President of Switzerland Cassis. Thanked for the humanitarian support of Ukraine and Ukrainians. The mediating role of Switzerland in helping Ukrainians who found themselves in Russia was discussed. Preparations for the conference on postwar reconstruction of our state were also discussed. We are doing everything to return normal life to the de-occupied part of our Ukraine. The work of humanitarian offices has already begun in 93% of de-occupied settlements. We are actively demining the liberated territory. Every day several dozen settlements are added to the list of those where demining has been completed. 69% of de-occupied settlements are again with full-fledged local self-government. We are restoring electricity supply, communications, water supply and gas supply. We are doing everything to return normal medicine, educational services, access to financial institutions. We are restoring roads. Of course, there is still a lot of work ahead. The occupiers are still on our land and still do not recognize the apparent failure of their so-called operation. We still need to fight and direct all efforts to drive the occupiers out. And we will do it. Ukraine will be free. Kherson, Nova Kakhovka, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Dniprorudne and all other temporarily occupied cities and communities in which the occupiers are now pretending to be ""masters"" will be liberated. The Ukrainian flag will return wherever it should be by right. Return with a normal life, which Russia is simply unable to provide even on its own territory. I signed a decree on awarding our defenders - warriors of the National Guard of Ukraine. 133 national guards were awarded state awards, 11 of them posthumously.

0,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! The 65th day of our defense is coming to an end. We are beating the occupiers in all directions where they are trying to advance. The situation in the Kharkiv region is tough. But our military, our intelligence, have important tactical success. In Donbas, the occupiers are doing everything to destroy any life in this area. Constant brutal bombings, constant Russian strikes at infrastructure and residential areas show that Russia wants to make this area uninhabited. Therefore, the defense of our land, the protection of our people is literally a struggle for life. For Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Popasna, Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Marinka and all other cities and communities of Donbas, which Russian troops want to turn into ruins, absolutely everything is being decided in this war. Only if Ukraine withstands will they live. If the Russian invaders succeed in realizing their plans, at least in part, they will still have enough artillery and aircraft to destroy the entire Donbas. Just as they destroyed Mariupol. The city, which was one of the most developed in the region, is simply a Russian concentration camp in the middle of ruins. And the order of the occupiers in that part of Mariupol which they unfortunately still control differs insignificantly from what the Nazis did in the occupied territory of Eastern Europe. But the Russian troops manage to be even more cynical than the Nazis 80 years ago. At that time, the invaders did not say that it was the Mariupol residents and the defenders of the city who shelled and killed themselves. I am grateful to the United States, President Biden and Congress for an analogue of the famous Lend-Lease program, which will be very helpful in the fight against Russia, against the Russian invaders. Which helped a lot in the fight against the Nazis during World War II. I am sure that now the Lend-Lease will help Ukraine and the whole free world beat the ideological successors of the Nazis, who started a war against us on our land. Lend-Lease and other programs in support of Ukraine are concrete proof that freedom is still able to defend itself against tyranny. Today, the Government of Ukraine considered the issue of eliminating the deficit in the fuel market. Queues and rising prices at gas stations are seen in many regions of our country. The occupiers are deliberately destroying the infrastructure for the production, supply and storage of fuel. Russia has also blocked our ports, so there are no immediate solutions to replenish the deficit. But government officials promise that within a week, maximum two, a system of fuel supply to Ukraine will be provided that will be able to prevent a deficit. This is a difficult task after the Russian missile strike at the Kremenchuk refinery. But government officials along with fuel suppliers, traders and networks must fulfill this task no matter how difficult it may be. I'm sure they will. We must take from the European Union as much fuel as our citizens need now. Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Ukraine Melinda Simmons returned to Kyiv today. Currently, 27 foreign diplomatic missions operate in the capital of our country. And this is an extremely important gesture of support for Ukraine, for which we are grateful to all of them. Such gestures, together with strong defensive, financial and political support from the free world, mean that the need to end the war is becoming more and more obvious to Russia. The defeat of the occupiers is unalterable. In the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region, collaborators say that they are allegedly preparing for the transition to the ""ruble zone"". Any attempt to transfer our territory to Russia's administrative, monetary, or any other system will mean only one thing: Russia itself will suffer from that. Our responses, sanctions and other reactions of the free world to Russia's aggressive actions will not be delayed. The dismantlement of debris in Kyiv, where Russian missiles hit yesterday during the visit of UN Secretary-General António Guterres, continues. Unfortunately, such a deliberate and brutal humiliation of the United Nations by Russia was left without a powerful response. Today it became known that a journalist, an employee of Radio Liberty Vera Hyrych was killed by a Russian missile hitting a residential building in Kyiv. She became the 23rd media representative whose life was cut short as a result of the Russian invasion since February 24. My condolences to all relatives and friends. Eternal memory to all the victims of this war! Today in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine in the Mariyinsky Palace, I presented awards to our defenders and members of the families of fallen warriors. The Order of the Golden Star was awarded to the Heroes of Ukraine: Lieutenant Colonel Serhiy Burkovsky, Captain Vitaliy Hural, Senior Lieutenant Dmytro Dozirchy, Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Zuhravy, Colonel Dmytro Kashchenko, Major Oleksandr Kukurba, Captain Oleh Pasichnyk, Lieutenant Colonel Vyacheslav Tsyhankov, Colonel of the Medical Service Oleksandr Sliesarenko, Lieutenant Colonel Leonid Khoda, Colonel Denys Chayuk and Lieutenant General Serhiy Nayev. Also, three servicemen were posthumously awarded the Order of the Golden Star. I had the honor to hand them over to the relatives of our heroes - Sergeant Volodymyr Balyuk, Master Sergeant Oleksandr Tsyupak, Major Pavlo Sbytov.

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today we have significant news for our state, for our defense. First, the United States has prepared a new support package for Ukraine worth $ 33 billion. In particular, more than 20 billion can be allocated for defense. More than $ 8 billion is planned for economic support. Another $ 3 billion will be allocated for humanitarian aid. This is a very important step by the United States. And I am grateful to the American people and personally to President Biden for it. I hope that the Congress will quickly support this request for help to our state. President Biden rightly said today that this step is not cheap. But the negative consequences of Russia's aggression against Ukraine and against democracy are so large-scale for the whole world that, in comparison with them, this support from the United States is necessary. Together, we can certainly stop Russian aggression and reliably defend freedom in Europe. We are also working to direct the blocked assets of Russian individuals subject to sanctions and the Russian state to compensate Ukraine for this war and to restore normal life. The investigation into the crimes committed by the Russian military against our people is underway. Ukraine's position is absolutely clear - every Russian criminal must be and will be brought to justice. Whoever they are and wherever they hide, we will find them all and make them bear responsibility. The first ten Russian servicemen from the 64th motorized rifle brigade of the Russian Ground Forces who committed crimes against our people in Bucha, Kyiv region, received the status of suspects. Their surnames are known. It is established what they did. We know all the details about them and their actions. And we will find everyone. Just as we will find all the other Russian thugs who killed and tortured Ukrainians. Who tormented our people. Who destroyed houses and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. None of these bastards will avoid responsibility. However, some of them may not survive until trial and fair punishment. But for one reason only. This Russian brigade was relocated to the Kharkiv region. There they will get retribution from our military. Prime Minister of Bulgaria Kiril Petkov paid a visit to Kyiv today. We had very substantive and very warm negotiations with him. Bulgaria is one of those countries that reacted to Russia's aggression in a principled manner and quickly. I am grateful to both the Bulgarian government and the Bulgarian people for not delaying the support for our state. Another issue we agreed on is the supply of Ukrainian electricity to Bulgaria and the use of the Trans-Balkan gas pipeline together with the Bulgarian side. I am grateful to Bulgaria for the opportunity to use the port of Varna to export our agricultural capacity. The UN Charter, international conventions, declarations, the rights of people and states... Everything that should guarantee freedom and security in the world is simply destroyed by Russia's aggressive actions. So the key issue in the talks with the UN Secretary-General was how to stop Russian aggression. And this is not just a question of Ukraine, our fate. This is a question of the fate of the United Nations, the fate of international law, the fate of many nations - and not just Russia's neighbors who may become the next victims of Moscow's aggressive ambitions. Of course, during the negotiations we paid a lot of attention to saving our people from Mariupol. I believe that with the help of the UN it is possible to organize an evacuation mission. Ukraine is ready for these steps. But it is also necessary for the Russian side to consider this issue without cynicism and actually do what it says. Moscow claimed they had allegedly ceased fire in Mariupol. But the bombing of the defenders of the city continues. This is a war crime committed by the Russian military literally in front of the whole world. Russia's shelling of Mariupol did not stop even when the UN Secretary-General was holding negotiations in Moscow. And today, immediately after the end of our talks in Kyiv, Russian missiles flew into the city. Five missiles. And this says a lot about Russia's true attitude to global institutions. About the efforts of the Russian leadership to humiliate the UN and everything that the Organization represents. Therefore, it requires a strong response. Russian missile strikes at Ukraine - Kyiv, Fastiv, Odesa, and other cities - once again prove that we cannot let our guard down. We cannot think that the war is over. We still have to fight. We still have to drive the occupiers out. Today, the Russian army continued its offensive attempts in the east of our country, in Donbas. Tries to advance in the southern regions. The Armed Forces of Ukraine repel the invaders. And I am grateful to each of our defenders who are holding positions. We are doing everything to help our army, to provide the military with all the necessary weapons. Every time I contact my partners, I emphasize that weapons for Ukraine right now, the very types we ask for and just when we need them, are salvation not only for our people. This is salvation for all of you - for all of Europe. I am grateful to those partners who understand this. And who help convince others. Before delivering the evening address, I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 214 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 14 of them posthumously.

0,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! The 63rd day of our defense is coming to an end. A day during which a lot has been done. First, an important decision of the European Union is being prepared. The European Commission has agreed to remove all duties and quotas on Ukrainian exports for a year, as well as to suspend anti-dumping tariffs. I discussed the details of this proposal with President Ursula von der Leyen today. I am grateful to her personally and to all our European friends for this step. Right now, this will allow us to maintain the economic activity in Ukraine, our national production as much as possible. But this decision needs to be considered not only in the Ukrainian context. Sufficient export of our products to European and global markets will be a significant anti-crisis tool. Russia is trying to provoke a global price crisis. To start chaos in all basic markets and especially in the food market. Ukrainian exports will help stabilize markets. So it is beneficial not only for us, but also for all Europeans. For residents of all countries that can be affected by Russia's destructive ambitions. New partners' decisions to liberalize our exports are expected soon. We are also agreeing with the European Union on how to increase the potential of transport corridors on our western border. I spoke today with the President of Indonesia. In particular, on food security. I stressed that the threat of famine for millions of people in different countries will remain until Russia begins to seek peace with Ukraine. It is because of this war waged by Russia that dozens of states have found themselves in a situation where they cannot be sure of stability for their people. I am grateful to Indonesia for supporting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our state, for an honest and responsible position during the UN voting. I am also grateful for the invitation to take part in this year's G20 summit. This week, Russia's leadership launched a new series of energy blackmail of Europeans. The decision to cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria is another argument in favor of the fact that no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia. Russia considers not only gas, but any trade as a weapon. It is just waiting for the moment when one or another trade area can be used. To blackmail Europeans politically. Or to strengthen Russia's military machine, which sees a united Europe as a target. Hence, the sooner everyone in Europe admits that it is inadmissible to depend on Russia in trade, the sooner it will be possible to guarantee stability in European markets. A meeting of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities took place today. The first meeting during the full-scale war. A set of issues was discussed. In particular, the reconstruction of our country. We are already working on all the details so that the post-war reconstruction project can be implemented quickly and most effectively. I stressed that we expect specific requests and proposals from local authorities. So that we can talk specifically with our partners, with the European Union, with international donors. Communities must provide all information about destroyed housing, all damaged objects. We discussed how and in what order to build, how to organize the purchase of ready housing. Our goal is not just to rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. But also to solve old problems with housing queues and so on. So that all servicemen, rescuers, policemen, all who work for the state are provided with their own housing. Today in Congress we heard the reports on the earliest possible provision of housing for IDPs. On the interaction between central and local authorities in the communities that are temporarily occupied. The issues of territorial defense development and coordination between local authorities and law enforcement agencies were discussed. Today I want to especially support Ukrainians in the south of our country. In Kherson, in all communities of the region, in the temporarily occupied districts of the Zaporizhzhia region. I am grateful to everyone who does not give up. Who protests. Who ignores the occupiers and shows those outcasts who have become collaborators that they have no future. The stronger our resistance now, the more rejection the occupiers will see, the sooner normal life will return to our land. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to beat the invaders throughout the territory where the fighting continues. I am grateful to each of our defenders who do everything for Russia to lose. Mariupol, Marinka, Popasna, Severodonetsk, Izyum, Rubizhne, Dniprorudne, Melitopol and all other cities and communities that are now at the epicenter of the struggle for Ukraine. That is where the fighting for the future of our people is taking place. Thank you to everyone who brings our victory closer! I have just signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 173 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards of Ukraine. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Lieutenant General Serhiy Ivanovych Nayev, Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for our state! Eternal memory to all who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Every year on April 26, the world remembers the Chornobyl disaster. The worst nuclear disaster in human history. But this year it is not enough to just remember Chornobyl. And it is not enough to say traditional words of gratitude to the heroes-liquidators. It is not enough to remind why and how the catastrophe became possible. It is not enough to repeat the conclusions that every intelligent person and every adequate society must draw. Because this year, Russia has created new threats that could surpass even the worst accident. I remember the night of March 4, when it became known about the fire at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. When Russian tanks fired at the station. They knew exactly which object they were firing at. But they had an order to seize the object at any cost. They did not care about anything. They did not care that the Zaporizhzhia station is the largest in Europe. They didn't think about how many power units there are and how the shelling could end. If the world had not woken up that night, we would not mention Chornobyl today, because everyone would think about what Russia has done at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is even surprising how quickly and completely Russia, the whole country, can forget about the worst catastrophe that its people have experienced as well. Not only Ukrainians were involved in the liquidation of the consequences of the Chornobyl accident in 1986. But also Belarusians, Russians and others. That catastrophe should have been told about in Russian schools as well. They should have reminded about it in Russia every year on April 26, as is done throughout the civilized world. Instead, today they launched three missiles against Ukraine so that they flew directly over the blocks of our nuclear power plants. Over three nuclear power plants at once. Over Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi and South-Ukrainian NPPs. What is it? Are they threatening? Are they targeting? There are no words... It turns out they do not realize what Chornobyl is. At all. Russian troops that were trying to attack Kyiv through the Chornobyl zone used the restricted area as a military base. They set up positions on land where it is forbidden to even stand. They drove armored vehicles through areas where radiation-contaminated materials are buried and where the number of radioactive particles is simply horrendous. They destroyed the dosimetric control points. The Chornobyl radiation monitoring system was broken and looted. They looted a nuclear analytical laboratory... They even stole contaminated items, which were confiscated from violators of the rules of the Exclusion Zone! Only thanks to the professionalism and conscientiousness of our specialists working at the Chornobyl station and other facilities of the Chornobyl zone, we managed to save Ukraine, save Europe from a new catastrophe. Only thanks to the professional team of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and our entire nuclear industry is it possible to ensure trouble-free operation of stations during the war. Today, I also awarded our heroes - shift workers at the Chornobyl station who did not leave the facility. Who maintained the work of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant despite the threat to their lives and despite the occupiers' lack of understanding of even the basics of radiation safety. I believe that after all that the Russian military has done in the Chornobyl zone and at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has. If Russia has forgotten what Chornobyl is, it means that global control over Russia's nuclear facilities and nuclear technology is needed. I spoke today with the Prime Minister of Japan. In particular, about the dangers created by Russia. About the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine. I thanked Japan for a strong package of sanctions, for its support and for the leadership needed to force Russia to peace and recognition of the foundations of international law. We also discussed the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine and the possible role of Japan in future security agreements. The Prime Minister of Romania paid a visit to Kyiv. I thanked him for the defensive and political support. We discussed not only bilateral cooperation between our states and joint work to protect freedom in Europe, but also cooperation at the EU level. With Romania, we share a common vision of both prospects and threats to European unity, in particular in the Black Sea region. We agreed to work together even harder to ensure security in our region. An important meeting at the level of defense ministers of Ukraine's partner countries took place in Germany today. The key issue was to strengthen the protection of the whole of Europe from Russia's aggressive ambitions. There are almost no people left in the free world who do not understand that Russia's war against Ukraine is just the beginning. The ultimate goal of Russia's leadership is not just to seize the territory of Ukraine, but to dismember the entire center and east of Europe and deal a global blow to democracy. Therefore, the free world has the right to self-defense. And that is why it will help Ukraine even more. I am grateful to the United Kingdom and personally to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his prompt and positive response to our request for trade liberalization. Right now it is especially important for the support of our state. Britain has announced the abolition of all duties and quotas on imports of Ukrainian goods. This will allow us to save thousands of jobs during the war and ensure a significant intensification of economic relations with Britain. We expect similar decision from other partners. I want to emphasize that this is important not only for our country, not only for each of the partner countries. This adds stability to global markets, especially the food market, which is one step away from a large-scale price crisis due to Russia's war against Ukraine. There is only one way to avoid the crisis: to strengthen cooperation and put pressure on Russia for it to give up this war. Today, Russian troops continued missile strikes at our land, particularly in the Odesa region. They continued to attack our troops near Kharkiv, in Donbas. They are trying to portray an alleged ""new government"" in Kherson and part of the Zaporizhzhia region. They change flags, demonstrate some suicides in the role of collaborators. And what does this give Russia? Only new losses. There will be a new sanctions package from the European Union. There will be even more restrictions on trade. Inevitably, the vast majority of the world's countries will abandon Russian oil and other Russian energy sources. No adequate country will want to invite Rosatom to cooperate. Most Russians will have to pay with poverty for the aggressive policy of their country's leadership. And I emphasize: we will identify, find and prosecute everyone - war criminals and collaborators. The longer and more brutal this war, the more resources will be spent not only by us, but also by the world to establish justice and punish all those responsible. The time will come when Russia will have to recognize that peace is needed. I paid a visit to Ilya Matvienko and Kira Obedinska in Okhmatdyt Hospital today. Kira is 12 years old, and Ilya turned 10 today. They lived in Mariupol until the Russian army came. Ilya's mother was killed during the bombing of the city. Kira's father, a well-known athlete and former captain of Ukraine's water polo team, Yevhen Obedinsky, was killed by a sniper. The occupiers took the children out of the city, actually abducted them, and it took a lot of effort to get them back. I am grateful to everyone who joined this cause. I am especially grateful to Iryna Vereshchuk and Andriy Yermak, who coordinated this task, to our entire team. Now Ilya is with his grandmother, Kira is with her grandfather. Their only relatives left. We will help them with everything they need. We will help raise children. And we will definitely do everything to return all our Ukrainian children to Ukraine. Let no one in Russia hope that Ukraine will forget or forgive the abduction of our children, the deportation of our citizens. And the destruction of Mariupol. I also thanked Okhmatdyt's doctors for their work. For saving lives and trying to restore children's peace of mind under all circumstances. Thank you very much, dear doctors. Before delivering the evening address, I traditionally signed a decree awarding our heroes. 243 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. Eternal gratitude to all our defenders! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country in the world! Today the third month of our war for our independence began. Russian-Ukrainian war. The third month! On February 24, most in the world did not even believe that we would withstand more than a week. Someone said - three days. A month ago, we still had to convince different countries that betting on Ukraine means winning. And now... Now everyone knows it. Thanks to the courage, wisdom of our defenders, thanks to the courage of all Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women our state is a real symbol of struggle for freedom. Everyone in the world - and even those who do not openly support us - agree that it is in Ukraine that the fate of Europe, the fate of global security, the fate of the democratic system is being decided. And above all, it is being decided what life in the center and east of our continent will be like and whether there will be life at all. Bucha, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv and Sumy, Izyum, Kharkiv, Volnovakha, Zolote, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Popasna and Mariupol... Missiles aimed at Odesa and Kramatorsk, Zhytomyr, Lviv, Kremenchuk and Kryvyi Rih... In all Ukraine's cities and communities, Russia has shown what it really wants and can bring to Europe. What it can bring to Chișinău, Tbilisi, Helsinki, Vilnius, Warsaw, Prague, all the cities and countries that Russian state propagandists have long openly identified as alleged enemies for Moscow. Russia has launched an offensive against Ukraine in many directions. Missile strikes, air raids, artillery, tanks - everything! Russian troops did not spare anything, any means to kill us, kill Ukrainians and destroy our land. In two months, they used more than 1100 missiles against us. Countless bombs and artillery. They tortured, robbed, executed. They mined our land. Peaceful cities and villages were turned into hell. Some Ukrainian cities and communities were destroyed to the ground. But they did not achieve anything. And they will not achieve. Kherson, Kakhovka, Melitopol, Dniprorudne, Enerhodar and our other cities where the Russian occupiers temporarily entered didn’t obey them. People showed with their protest their attitude towards the occupiers, showed that Ukraine will definitely win. Russia wants to play a sham ""referendum"" somewhere on our land? Even if they try, it will be as shameful as everything else that was ""created"" in Moscow for the occupation of Ukraine. Kharkiv region, Donetsk, Luhansk - the Russian military didn’t see even the slightest support they had hoped for anywhere. But they saw that it is a completely different state. They saw that there are completely different people here. People who are confident. Who believe in their state. Who know how to respect others because they respect themselves. Who do not want to capture someone else’s land, but will not give anything of their own. Who will protect every city, every street, every field. In two months of hostilities 9 thousand 781 defenders of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 142 of our defenders. Ukrainian men and women have shown a truly massive readiness to defend Ukraine. At any age, any property status, with any education - Ukrainian men and women equally stood up for the state. This war has truly become a people’s war for Ukraine. And it showed that throughout our territory - from east to west, from north to south - the Ukrainian idea is equally strong, equally national. As of this time, 931 settlements have already been de-occupied. Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army. But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land. Russia can spend enormous resources to support the war. To oppose even the whole free world. It can take away from its people everything that could develop Russia itself, and direct this potential to destroy the lives of neighbors. But the lessons of history are well known. If you are going to build a millennial Reich, you lose. If you are going to destroy the neighbors, you lose. If you want to restore the old empire, you lose. And if you go against the Ukrainians, you lose. A global anti-war coalition was formed in two months. Sanctions have already been imposed on Russia, which have taken away its future. Ukraine receives assistance from dozens of countries. This is support in the form of weapons, finances, necessary goods, political support directly. We are accelerating our movement to the European Union as much as possible. We have already passed a historic moment, an important stage - with the receipt and answering a special questionnaire, which was provided to each country before they acquired the status of a candidate for EU membership. Even now, when the war is still going on, we are creating the necessary base for the reconstruction of Ukraine. These are international agreements of various levels, this is the creation of special funds for the reconstruction of our state. Even now, when Russia is still trying to seize our territory, we are demonstrating that we will give free Ukraine more opportunities for development than Russia can give not only to the occupied part of our territory, but also to its own territory, its own state. It is obvious that every day - and especially today, when the third month of our resistance has begun - everyone in Ukraine is concerned about peace. About when all this will be over. About when and what can be a victory for Ukraine. There is and at the same time there is no simple answer to this question. When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable. Ukraine is ready for peace. It was ready even when the war was going on in Donbas. It is ready even now, when the Russian invasion has become full-scale. But for Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight. They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory. As always, before delivering the address, I signed decrees awarding our heroes. 269 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 9 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate were awarded state awards. Eternal glory to all who stood up for the state! Eternal gratitude to all who help us endure! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Yesterday, Christians of the Eastern rite celebrated Easter. The traditional greeting ""Christ is risen!"" sounded also in Russia. But did these words mean the same thing as in the whole Orthodox world? Russia ""congratulated"" Ukraine on Easter with an air threat almost all over our country, a missile strike at the Poltava region, and a missile strike at Kremenchuk. Why was this attack needed at Easter? There is no military threat from which this could protect Russia. This is just a deliberate destruction of life in Ukraine. Destruction that did not stop even on the greatest Orthodox holiday. So are these people who continued to shell our cities and communities yesterday Christians? Who fired at Chuhuiv of the Kharkiv region. Who killed two more children in the Donetsk region on Easter - girls aged five and fourteen. Killing children, destroying lives, covering up with cynical and total lies what has been done against peaceful cities - all Russia is doing on the territory of Ukraine - is definitely not Christianity. This is what Christ opposed. People who once again refused to open humanitarian corridors from Mariupol are not Christians. People who filmed propaganda reports in the occupied regions of Ukraine about the distribution of alleged humanitarian Easter kits are not Christians. Moreover, everyone knows, including in Russia, that before February 24, all Ukrainians in all parts of Ukraine had the opportunity to celebrate Easter freely in any church and without any ""humanitarian"" kits. People who are trying to build a brutal occupation regime in the seized districts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, holding people hostage, torturing people are not Christians. Those who did not allow people to leave the occupied territory even on Easter, threatening them with death. Russia was offered an Easter ceasefire. But the Orthodox world has seen that for the Russian invaders Easter means nothing. For them, it is just a red date in the calendar, which requires special words, special behavior, but not what is called faith, and not what is called Christian good. The Russian army has made this Easter red not only formally in the calendar, but also red with blood. Christians would not do that if they had the opportunity to make peace. So holding a candle in the temple does not mean being a Christian. Eating or even celebrating Easter every year is not enough to be human, to be a Christian. And I am grateful to all our police officers, to all employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, to all those who were responsible for security on Easter, for not allowing any provocations yesterday. All that Russian propagandists announced recently. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring attacks by Russian troops in key areas. In the Kharkiv region - in the Izyum direction, in Donbas - especially near Popasna, in Mariupol where the resistance of the city's defenders continues, in the southern areas, where the occupiers are trying to go on the offensive. Air alarms this morning were heard again almost all over our country. Vinnytsia, Rivne, Lviv, Odesa regions - missile threat. Russia does not stop trying to break our resistance to... Achieve what? In the occupied areas, either a humanitarian catastrophe has already occurred or there is very little time left before it occurs. There is a lack of basic products, there is a lack of medicines. People do not have the means to live normally, there is no basic security. They don’t have everything they had before February 24. What Donetsk and Luhansk had before 2014. Everything that we will definitely return after the liberation of our land. We continue to do everything to drive the occupiers out and restore peace to all our people. A key element of this process is the strength of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Availability of sufficient quantity and quality of weapons, sufficient quantity and quality of ammunition. Assistance to Ukraine was the number one issue in talks with representatives of the United States of America who arrived in Kyiv yesterday - Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Our talks with them were long enough - more than three hours - and meaningful. Encouraging and, which is important, effective. I am grateful to the people of the United States and personally to President Biden for the strong and sincere support we receive. These are real things that strengthen not only our state, but democracy as a whole. We share the same understanding with the United States: when democracy wins in one country, it wins all over the world. When freedom is defended in one country, it is defended all over the world. We agreed with the American side on further steps to strengthen the Armed Forces of Ukraine and meet all the priority needs of our army. This includes preparations for a major ministerial meeting in Germany on Tuesday, which will bring together forty defense ministers from partner countries. The key issue is the protection of Ukraine, the protection of freedom in Eastern Europe. Ways to strengthen sanctions were discussed. The fact that Russia is not looking for peace and is demonstratively killing even on Easter shows that greater sanctions pressure is needed. It is necessary to block all opportunities for Russia to circumvent sanctions. So we handed over to our partners a special Plan to strengthen sanctions on the Russian Federation developed by an international expert group led by Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul. A separate point of the negotiations was financial support for Ukraine. When tyranny has enormous financial resources from oil and gas exports, the issue of financial support for freedom becomes vital. I heard a full understanding of this position from American friends. Not only in the context of helping Ukraine now, during the war, but also for the post-war reconstruction. Discussions on security guarantees for Ukraine continued. I am convinced that the United States can be a leader among the future countries - guarantors of Ukraine's security. The main goal for all of us is to make Europe and the world safer after the war, to ensure that the security architecture works in the event of any new threats. I was pleased to hear from our friends that the United States Embassy will be back in Kyiv in the near future. The appointment of a new US Ambassador to Ukraine will also take place. This is a very useful gesture of support for our state. I had an important conversation with Turkish President Erdoğan. On the situation in Mariupol and the need to evacuate civilians and the wounded, the need for immediate exchange of the blocked Ukrainian military. We discussed the negotiation process with Russia and the issues of defense. The threats to the world food market provoked by Russia, which has blocked our Black Sea ports, were also discussed in detail. Rising food prices have already reached critical levels in many countries. But this is just the beginning. If Russia does not seek peace, the issue of food security in many countries will become a matter of physical survival for millions of people and, consequently, stability of state systems. More and more political leaders around the world are aware of this threat. So we expect more pressure on Russia. Late last night, after all foreign policy issues, I signed important decrees to award our heroes. 188 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and five employees of the Security Service of Ukraine were awarded state awards of Ukraine. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Chayuk Denys Valentynovych, deputy commander of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade, for personal courage and effectiveness in battles with the occupiers, for destroying enemy equipment and manpower. Glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Great people of great Ukraine! Today is a great holiday. And I'm in a great place. The Great St. Sophia Cathedral. In the cathedral, which was founded a thousand years ago, on the field of the sacred battle where the army of Kyivan Rus’-Ukraine defeated the Pechenegs. In the cathedral, which was not destroyed by the Horde invasion or the Nazi occupation, which withstood in spite of everything! Today we all believe in a new victory for Ukraine. And we are all convinced that we will not be destroyed by any horde or evil. We are enduring dark times. And on this bright day, most of us are not in bright clothes. But we are fighting for a bright idea. On the bright side. And the truth, people, the Lord and the holy heavenly light are on our side. The power of the patron saint of the human race - Oranta. She is above me. She is above us all. The unshakable pillar of the Church of Christ, the unbreakable wall of the main stronghold - Kyiv, the Unbreakable Wall of the State. As long as there is Oranta, there is Sophia, and Kyiv stands with her, and the whole of Ukraine stands with them! Above the image of Oranta are the words from the Psalms: “God dwells in that city; it cannot be destroyed. From the very break of day, God will protect it."" On this Great Day, we all believe that our dawn is coming soon. Oranta in Latin means ""one who prays"". We have all been praying for the last two months. And in the Resurrection of Christ, which symbolizes the great victory of life over death, each of us asks the Lord for one thing. And speaks the same words to heaven. The words of a great and united prayer. Great and Only God! Save our Ukraine! Protect those who protect us! Heaven, protect those who defend the native land. Strengthen the will of those who protect us from captivity. Save those who save Ukraine. These are our military, national guards, border guards, our territorial defense, intelligence. These and all our other warriors of light. Help those who help them. These are volunteers and all people who care. From Ukraine and around the world. Give strength to all who give all their strength. May everyone who seeks always find. May everyone who is on the road always overcome it. And may everyone who does everything possible to save Ukraine never lose faith that everything is possible. Save the lives of those who save the lives of others. These are all our medics. Our firefighters, rescuers, sappers. May the victory of life be a symbol not only of this holiday. May life win the battle against death every day. Take care of our mothers. Give endurance to those who are waiting for a son or daughter from the war. Give fortitude to those who, unfortunately, have lost their children on the frontline. Help those who have lost their children in peaceful cities and villages where Russia has brought death to overcome unbearable pain. And give good health to all our mothers and all our grandmothers for many more years. To see their loved ones. To see peace and victory. To see justice. And the happy old age that the invaders are trying to steal from them. And instead of knitting scarves and sweaters for their grandchildren, today they weave camouflage nets. So give many years of peaceful life to them. And to our fathers. And to our grandfathers. Who once told their grandchildren about the war, and today send grandchildren to the war. Our fathers and our grandfathers built this country. Today they see it being destroyed. Let them see how our land will be liberated and rebuilt. And give us strength to do it. Take care of all our children. Give every boy and every girl a happy youth, maturity and old age, which will allow at least a little to get rid of the memories of their terrible childhood during the war. Not children's, scary games that they were forced to play. Hide and seek, but in the basement, from the bombs. Running, but from the gunshots. Travel, but because of the loss of home, fleeing the war. Save all Ukrainians! We did not attack anyone, so give us protection. We have never destroyed other nations, so do not let anyone destroy us. We did not seize other people's lands, so do not let anyone seize ours. Save Ukraine! Its right and left banks - at a time when we are being viciously beaten on both right and left cheeks. At the end of winter, spring did not come to us. Severe cold was brought to our house. At dawn we were brought opaque darkness. We believe, God, that in your judgment you will not forget them all. All those who have forgotten all your commandments. You will not forget about Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Hostomel. All those who survived brutal crimes. Give them and all our land human happiness. You will not forget about Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv, Izyum, Kramatorsk and Volnovakha, Popasna. All other towns and villages that hear the terrible explosions. Let them and all of us hear the fireworks of victory. You will not forget about Mariupol and its heroic defenders. One can destroy the walls, but can't destroy the foundation on which the morale stands. The morale of our warriors. The morale of the whole country. We see terrible scenes of war. Let us see a happy picture of peace. We are going through very difficult ordeals. Let us reach a just end on this path - the beginning of a happy life and prosperity of Ukraine! Our hearts are full of fierce fury. Our souls are full of fierce hatred for the invaders and all that they have done. Don't let fury destroy us from within. Turn it into our accomplishments from the outside. Turn it into a force of good to defeat the forces of evil. Save us from strife and division. Don't let us lose unity. Strengthen our will and our spirit. Don't let us lose ourselves. Don't let us lose our longing for freedom. Therefore, do not let us lose our zeal for a righteous struggle. Do not let us lose hope of victory and self-esteem, and therefore our freedom. And therefore Ukraine. And therefore faith. Dear Ukrainians!  Last year we celebrated Easter at home because of the pandemic. This year we also celebrate the Resurrection of Christ not as we used to. Because of another virus. Because of the plague called war. Both last year's and the current threat are united by one thing - nothing can defeat Ukraine. The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win! And on Easter, we ask God for great grace to make our great dream come true - this is another great day - the day when great peace will come to Ukraine. And with it - eternal harmony and prosperity. With faith and confidence in this - I congratulate all of you on Easter. Take care of yourselves. Take care of your loved ones. Take care of Ukraine! Christ is Risen!  He is Risen Indeed.

0,"Today I will begin my evening address to you without greetings. Today Russia launched another missile strike at Ukraine, at Odesa. As of now - 8 dead. At least 18 wounded. Ordinary peaceful people. Among those killed was a 3-month-old baby girl. How did she threaten Russia? It seems that killing children is just a new national idea of the Russian Federation. The missiles were launched by Russian strategic aircraft. From the Caspian Sea region. We managed to shoot down two missiles. Five more missiles hit a peaceful city. Including the usual apartment house, the usual high-rise building. We will identify all those responsible for this strike. Those responsible for Russia's missile terror. Everyone who gives these orders. Everyone who fulfills these orders. No one will be able to hide. No matter how long it takes us, all these bastards will be responsible for every death they caused. Russia has already fired most of its missile arsenal at Ukraine. Of course, they still have missiles. Of course, they can still continue the missile terror against our people. But what they have already done is definitely arguments sufficient for the world to eventually recognize the Russian state as a sponsor of terrorism and the Russian army as a terrorist organization. We will continue to insist on this in negotiations with our partners. There is simply no alternative to such recognition. That is why it is true. The Russian state has become a terrorist, and it is not ashamed. And if it is not ashamed, it is deliberate. Therefore, there must be maximum responsibility. New facts about the crimes of the occupiers against our Mariupol residents are being revealed. New graves of people killed by the occupiers are being found. We are talking about tens of thousands of dead Mariupol residents. Negotiations of the occupiers on how they conceal the traces of their crimes are recorded. Russia continues the activities of so-called filtration camps, particularly near Mariupol. Although the honest name for them is, in fact, different - it's concentration camps. Like those built by the Nazis in the past. Ukrainians from these camps - the survivors - are sent further into the occupied territories and to Russia. The facts of deportation of our citizens to the Russian boondocks, to Siberia, even to Vladivostok are recorded. They also deport children hoping that they will forget where their home is and where they are from. And they are from Ukraine. Today was Holy Saturday for Christians of the Eastern Rite. The day between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. It seems that Russia is stuck on such a day. For years. On the day when death triumphs and God is supposedly gone. But there will be a Resurrection. Life will defeat death. The truth will defeat any lies. And evil will be punished. And Russia will have to learn these truths again, it's only a matter of time. It is only a matter of time before all Russian murderers feel what a fair response to their crimes is. It is only a matter of time before we can bring all the deported Ukrainians home. It is only a matter of time before all our people all over Ukraine feel what a strong peace is. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. I informed him about the situation in Mariupol, in the areas of hostilities in general. I thanked him for the significant defensive and financial support for Ukraine. We coordinated further steps needed to protect our freedom. We are also preparing for tomorrow's important talks with American partners. I held a big live press conference in Kyiv today. Answered many questions - different, from different journalists. Both Ukrainian and foreign. And it's not just about openness, really. Not just about information. It's about whose side the truth is on in the war. This is about who can speak truthfully both with his people and with the whole world. Ukrainians can. Our enemies cannot. And finally. There will be a curfew tonight. Please follow this rule. This is important from a security point of view. But starting from 5 am you will be able to visit temples in your cities, towns and communities. Where it is possible to hold a church service. Please - only in the morning. I am grateful to each of our defenders who ensure our security this night before Easter and every day. Who defend the state. Who fight for the freedom of Ukrainians. Eternal glory to all our warriors! Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 58th day of our defense is coming to an end. It ends on Good Friday, one of the most sorrowful days of the year for Christians. The day when death seems to have won. But... We hope for a resurrection. We believe in the victory of life over death. And we pray that death loses. This year, during the full-scale war, Russia's war against our state, these words have a special meaning for us. Russia brought death to Ukraine. After eight years of brutal war in Donbas, Russia wanted to destroy our state completely. Literally deprive Ukrainians of the right to life. But no matter how fierce the battles are, there is no chance for death to defeat life. Everyone knows that. Every Christian knows that. This is a basic element of our culture. Perhaps this does not exist in modern Russian culture anymore. Because in order to do everything they did to Ukrainians in our cities... you have to kill a human inside you. Because a human of any faith simply cannot do that. But for our culture, it all matters. And it will matter. And life will surely defeat death. I am grateful to our British friends for the important symbolic decision announced today to return the embassy to Kyiv. The United Kingdom became the twenty-first country to return a diplomatic mission to our capital. And this shows that we are not the only ones who believe in the victory of life over death. Today, with reference to the Russian military, the news was spread that their task now is allegedly to establish control over the south of Ukraine and reach the Moldovan border. And allegedly there, in Moldova, the rights of Russian-speakers are violated. Although, to be honest, the territory in which Russia should take care of the rights of Russian-speakers is Russia itself. Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of choice. Where there is simply no right to dissent. Where poverty thrives and where human life is worthless. To the extent that they come to us, go to war to steal at least something that resembles a normal life. You know they used to talk about their biggest dream: to see Paris and die. And their behavior is now just shocking. Because their dream now is to steal the toilet and die. Well, this only confirms what I have said many times: the Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to capture other countries. Of course, we will defend ourselves as long as necessary to break this ambition of the Russian Federation. But all nations that, like us, believe in the victory of life over death must fight with us. They have to help us, because we are the first on this path. And who is next? If anyone who can become next wants to stay neutral today so as not to lose anything, this is the riskiest bet. Because you will lose everything. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to deter attacks by Russian invaders in the east and south of our country. The Izyum direction, Donbas, Pryazovia, Mariupol, Kherson region are the places where the fate of this war and the future of our state is being decided. In Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region in general, in Popasna and in the Luhansk region in general, in Kharkiv, in the surrounding areas, the occupiers are trying to achieve a primitive goal - to kill as much as possible and destroy everything they see. And I am grateful to each of our defenders who are bravely holding on, teaching the Russian army the idea that Russia's chances in this war may be less than Ukraine's. As every morning, as every day, as every evening, we have paid maximum attention today to provide our military with all the necessary weapons. This is the number one task for our state. And I am grateful to all our partners who finally heard us. Who provide us with exactly what we asked for. Because we know for sure that with these weapons we will be able to save the lives of thousands of people. And we will be able to show the occupiers that the day when they will be forced to leave Ukraine is approaching. The return to normal life in the territories liberated from the occupiers continues. If at the beginning of this week demining took place in 70 settlements, today 184 settlements have been demined. Of course, much remains to be done. But the pace, I think, is pretty good. Humanitarian headquarters are already operating in more than 500 de-occupied settlements. Almost 100 settlements are added daily, to which we return medical and educational services, the work of social protection bodies, financial institutions. We are restoring transport connections at a fairly fast pace. Plus 96 settlements today, where the transport connection was returned. Plus 183 settlements where gas stations have resumed work. Plus 90 settlements where electricity was restored. We return water supply, gas supply, mobile connection. The return of Ukraine to cities and communities means the return of life in the full sense of these words. I believe that such a return will take place in the south of our country and in the east of Ukraine. In all areas where degradation, destruction and death have been brought under the Russian flag. But it depends on how united we all will be in countering the Russian invasion. I emphasize once again that everyone should oppose the occupation at every opportunity. Ignore the occupiers. Do not cooperate with them. Don't help them. Neutralize collaborators. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are performing their tasks brilliantly. Intelligence, the National Guard, territorial defense, police, border guards - all of them work one hundred percent for the victory. But every citizen must also work for the victory - in what he does and where he is. If you are abroad - support Ukraine. If you are engaged in ordinary economic activities, do your best for the benefit of Ukraine as much as possible. If you found yourself in a temporarily occupied territory - try to cause the occupiers as much trouble as possible. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are our foundation. But a fortress of our national unity must always stand on this foundation. Unity of all Ukrainians who fight for life and against death. Against the Russian invasion. Traditionally, in the evening I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 48 defenders of Ukraine were awarded state awards. For courage in battles, for exemplary military service. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today was a very meaningful foreign policy day for Ukraine. First, the Prime Ministers of Spain and Denmark, two countries that have consistently supported Ukraine, have arrived in Kyiv. Thank you. The two leaders whose presence in Kyiv encourages other leaders of the democratic world to think about visits to Ukraine, about new gestures of support for our state, about concrete decisions that we need to win. I thanked them for helping our defense. For sanctions pressure on Russia. I called on Spain, Denmark and all other European democracies to further strengthen sanctions for this war. To finally impose an oil embargo, to disconnect the entire banking system of Russia from the global financial system. And to help us bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes against Ukrainians. The Prime Minister of Denmark stated readiness to support the program of post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular the reconstruction and development of Mykolaiv and the shipbuilding industry of Ukraine. Let me remind you that this is the direction of reconstruction I proposed when addressing the Parliament and the people of Denmark in March. And today I addressed the Parliament and the people of Portugal. This was the 26th address to the parliaments of our partner states. I can say that each of these speeches really gives us additional support. Brings the decision to provide assistance to Ukraine, including defensive one, closer. And most importantly, each of these addresses helps establish a direct emotional connection between what we are experiencing in Ukraine and what the political class is experiencing in the partner countries. I also addressed the participants of the special spring session of the World Bank today. This is one of the most important events for the heads of international financial institutions and finance ministers of leading states. We are accumulating financial support for Ukraine. The United States has announced a new package of support for our state. We are grateful for that. This package contains very powerful defense tools for our military. In particular, it is artillery, shells, drones. This is what we expected. I am grateful to the partners for their help and call for further acceleration of the supply of weapons to Ukraine so that we can bring peace closer. In the south and east of our country, the occupiers continue to do everything to have a reason to talk about at least some victories. They are accumulating forces, driving new battalion tactical groups to our land. They are even trying to start the so-called mobilization in the occupied regions of Ukraine. None of these steps will help Russia in the war against our state. They can only delay the inevitable - the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory. In particular Mariupol. A city that continues to resist Russia. Despite everything the occupiers say. I urge the residents of the southern regions of Ukraine - Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions - to be very careful about what information you provide to the invaders. And if they ask you to fill out some questionnaires, leave your passport data somewhere, you should know - this is not to help you. Not just to carry out a ""census"" of people who live in a certain area, as they say. No. And not to give you any humanitarian aid. This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. And this is the reality. Be careful. I want to say straight away: any ""Kherson People's Republics"" are not going to fly. If someone wants a new annexation, it can only lead to new powerful sanctions strikes on Russia. You will make your country as poor as Russia hasn’t been since the 1917 civil war. So it is better to seek peace now. Unfortunately, Russia rejected the proposal to establish an Easter truce. This shows very well how the leaders of this state actually treat the Christian faith, one of the most joyful and important holidays. But we keep our hope. Hope for peace, hope that life will overcome death. Tomorrow is Good Friday for Eastern Christians. The most sorrowful day of the year. A day when everything you can do in life will weigh less than prayer. Except for one... defending the Homeland, defending brothers-in-arms in battle. A few minutes ago, before delivering this address, I signed another decree on awarding our heroes, our military. 202 defenders of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 194 servicemen of the Armed Forces and 8 servicemen of the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who defends the state! Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear ladies and gentlemen, ministers! Greetings to all present at this historic World Bank session and thank you for the opportunity to address you today. Russian troops have been shelling and bombing it for weeks. In those parts of the city where Russian weapons reach, more than a thousand houses have already been destroyed. Russian artillery, Russian missiles, Russian air bombs do not choose who to kill and which buildings to blow up and burn. It is equally dangerous both in the center of Kharkiv and on the outskirts. You can die from Russian shelling everywhere. But you need to know the people of Kharkiv. You need to know our people... Even during the war, during such shelling, Kharkiv remains a fully functioning city. We managed to liberate from the occupiers the cities and communities of three northern regions of Ukraine - Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy. We immediately do everything to restore normal life there. Russian troops have destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of houses in these regions. Almost all social facilities, most of the economically important enterprises of Ukraine have been burned or need to be repaired. Thousands of people were killed. We restore electricity, communications, we restore water supply. We restore traffic, set up temporary bridges across rivers instead of destroyed ones. We return social and administrative services. We carry out demining. Several thousand explosive devices are neutralized daily. These are mines, tripwire mines and shells left over from the Russian military. Imagine, they mined even ordinary people's homes. Home appliances that they failed to steal and take away. Cars. Basements. They even mined agricultural fields... But even in such conditions, our people return home. Ukrainians are already trying to do everything to restore normal life. Because that's who we are, Ukrainians. In the east of our state, in Donbas, in the south the situation is even worse. And right now active hostilities are still going on there. Russia is still trying to develop a new brutal offensive there... I will cite only one figure now so that you can understand the scale of Ukraine's ordeal, our people's ordeal. Due to the bombing and shelling by Russian troops in Ukraine, 1,141 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged. Schools, kindergartens, universities. All over our country! Not every country in the world has as many educational institutions as destroyed by Russian troops in Ukraine. And if so many educational institutions were destroyed, you can imagine how much else was destroyed. Hospitals, infrastructure, businesses and ordinary houses. The Russian invasion completely destroyed normal economic relations. The first loss analysis alone yielded approximately $ 550 billion in losses. Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. This has significantly reduced Ukrainian exports, including agricultural products. Due to the shortage of Ukrainian food on the world market, the beginning of the crisis is already being felt. A recent report by the UN World Food Program stated that rising food prices this year would lead to starvation of about 47 million people in 81 countries. Without Ukrainian wheat, corn, vegetable oil and other commodities, this will result not only in physical food shortages in many countries in Africa and Asia, but also in political instability and possibly a new migration crisis. People will look for the culprits of this crisis, in particular, taking to the squares in their countries, in their cities. People will look for ways to escape. Of course, we do our best to export our products. We launched a sowing campaign this year - as much as possible. But no one in the world can be sure that food security can be guaranteed as long as this war continues - Russia's war on our land. Stopping the war now and liberating our territory from Russian invaders is the only reliable way to stop the food crisis. The Russian troops are deliberately destroying all facilities in our country that could provide an economic basis for life. Railway stations, food warehouses, bakery plants, oil terminals, etc... As of now, given the economic downturn and broken economic ties, we need up to $ 7 billion in financial support each month. Ukraine will need hundreds of billions of dollars to recover from this war. I'm sure each of you has these calculations, I'm sure of it. We must also honestly say that Russia is accompanying this war against us with aggressive measures on world markets. They specifically create such conditions that there is instability not only in the food market, but also in the fuel market and in the raw materials markets in general. Russia has provoked rising energy prices in Europe and more broadly in the democratic world. With sufficient export potential, they have constantly held back gas, in particular, to create painful price conditions for European consumers. So that people put pressure on their governments in the middle of the state for the sake of Russia's political interests. This and many other similar examples show that Russia can no longer be considered a normal and reliable supplier of energy resources, a normal and reliable trading partner. Together we are able to implement solutions that will not only stop the aggressive intentions of the Russian Federation, not only support Ukraine in this war, but also inevitably show all the potential aggressors of the world that creating problems for other states, for other nations means creating problems for themselves. Because if we do not do this, millions and millions of people in the world will repeatedly suffer from the aggressive actions of individual states. So, what steps are needed now? The first is immediate support for Ukraine, so that the Russian leadership knows that the war will not allow them to realize any of their aggressive goals. I am sure that our Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, who are present at this meeting, will talk about the details of such financial support. We must do everything to ensure that Ukraine and Ukrainians have everything they need to live despite the war. In Kharkiv, which I mentioned at the beginning of this speech, and in all other cities and communities of Ukraine. Everywhere. Second, Russia must be immediately excluded from all international financial institutions. The IMF, the World Bank and others are definitely not the place for a state that is trying to ruin the lives of its neighbors. Third, we need a special tax for the war. Russia, and after it any other aggressor, must pay for violating global stability. Such a tax for the war should be imposed on all, without exception, trade transactions with Russia as a state or with Russian companies. On all export-import transactions, all financial transactions that have not yet been blocked. Funds from the war tax should be used to help Ukraine rebuild everything that Russia destroyed in the war. Or, if this tax is applied to another aggressor, the funds should be directed to the victim of that war. The world needs an effective tool to respond to the destructive actions of those who do not want to maintain common security and work for the common good of all in the world. I am convinced that a special tax for the war can become such a tool. Fourth, every country in the world needs to prepare now for the possible complete severance of any relations with Russia. No one should depend on the political mood of the leadership of this state. If the world is ready to isolate Russia completely, the Russian leadership will have a motive to avoid any war. And fifth, significant assets of the Russian state and representatives of the Russian elite have already been blocked. However, these are not all their assets that we are aware of. This blocking work must be continued. And not just as an end in itself. Russia's blocked funds must be used both to rebuild Ukraine after the war and to compensate for the damage that Russia has caused to other nations with its destructive behavior. If because of the war unleashed by Russia famine starts in certain regions, or if some countries are substantially affected by inflation, blocked Russian assets could be used to pay for aid and compensation. We must use all our strength to make Russia feel punishment for this war. And feel how great the need to restore peace is - including for Russia itself. So by helping us, you can help yourself as well. Stabilize the financial situation in our region and in the world in general. Ensure security in key markets, starting with food. With your financial support and decisions, we will quickly rebuild our state. And this means not only new opportunities for business from different countries, not only new opportunities for economic growth, but also concrete evidence that global financial institutions are able to work in the interests of ordinary people, in the interests of humanity as a whole. I want one of the next such meetings to take place in Ukraine. In one of our cities - maybe in Kharkiv - with your support. Thank you very much for your attention! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies! The people of Portugal! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you at such a time, the darkest time for our state. Yesterday, in the town of Borodyanka near our capital, two more graves of civilians killed by the Russian occupiers were found. In one of these graves there are the bodies of two 35-year-old men and a 15-year-old girl. In the second grave there are six people: four men and two women. They were killed when Russian troops controlled Borodyanka. The bodies were buried in the middle of the town, near ordinary houses. Such burials are found in all communities now, in all the cities we liberate from the Russian occupiers. The world has already remembered the name of the Ukrainian city of Bucha, which is a 20-minute drive from Borodyanka. It remembered the horrible photos of the bodies of those killed just on the streets of Bucha. For weeks, the murdered people have laid on the road, on the sidewalks, near houses. Russian soldiers did not even try to remove these corpses. And they did not allow, by the way, local residents who remained in the city to bury them. I'm sure most of you have seen those photos. But in these photos it is far from everything the locals had to go through. The occupiers killed people even for fun and to loot their houses. People were thrown to die in the well. Tortured. Executed. Grenades were thrown into the basements where people were hiding from shelling. The Russian military killed refugees on the roads. They opened fire on cars with the word ""Children"" written on them. Hundreds of such riddled and burned cars remained on the roads... In the Kyiv region alone - and this is as of today, because not all burials have been found yet - the occupiers killed 1,126 Ukrainians. 40 of them are children. In the Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and other regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops entered, they caused the same hell as in Borodyanka or Bucha. Just one example. In the village of Yahidne in the Chernihiv region, the occupiers drove all the villagers into the basement of the school and kept them there for weeks. This is a small village school, a small basement in which about 10 people died of suffocation alone. The youngest child in the basement was 3 months old. Imagine a three month old baby! And the oldest person was 93 years old. And in total there were about 400 people in the basement! More than three weeks. Day and night they were forbidden to go out of the basement even to the toilet. And when people asked for clothes for children, the occupiers demanded that they sing the Russian national anthem. That's how the Russian military had fun. This is the impunity they felt. This is what is happening in Ukraine now. In 2022. We are fighting against Russian troops not just for our state. Not just for independence. But literally for the survival of our people. So that Ukrainians are not executed. So that Ukrainians are not tortured. So that Ukrainians are not raped. And so that Ukrainians are not deported to Russia. The Russian occupiers have already deported at least 500,000 our citizens from the territory they have occupied. It's like your two cities of Porto. Just imagine that. There were people - and now they are gone. 500 thousand people! This is deportation. This is what the worst totalitarian regimes of the past did. The deported Ukrainians are deprived of means of communication, everything is taken away from them, even documents. They are distributed to the remote regions of Russia. The occupiers set up special filtration camps to distribute people. Some of those who get there are simply killed. Girls are raped. Imagine what it's like when a girl escapes from such a Russian filtration camp, and when asked how she did it, she says Russian soldiers simply didn’t like her. Because if they had liked her, she would have been raped and then killed, like many others. During the 57 days of the full-scale war, we liberated about a thousand settlements of Ukraine, which were captured by Russia, by the invaders. However, the number of occupied cities and communities is much bigger. Russian troops do not stop shelling and bombing our cities. They are destroying residential areas, any civilian infrastructure that allows cities to maintain normal life. Food warehouses, schools, universities, hospitals, even churches are being blown up. More than 10 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes due to hostilities. Imagine this number. It's as if the whole of Portugal was forced to flee! I do not want to call these 10 million Ukrainians refugees. We use the term ""displaced persons"" to refer to them, these people. We hope that they will all be able to return home when it is safe. But when will it be? And what will be left of their house? Today, the Russian Defense Minister reported to the Russian leader on the hostilities against our city of Mariupol. You have all heard about Mariupol. Before the war, it was a city comparable in size to Lisbon. It was a half-million seaside city. Now it is completely destroyed. There is not a single undamaged building in Mariupol. Literally scorched city. For more than a month, the Russian troops have kept Mariupol under siege. Even humanitarian goods were not allowed. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were there without food, without water, without medicine. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing. Russian troops used aircraft to destroy even shelters and they knew for sure that there was no one there but civilians. Some Mariupol residents managed to escape, and for most of them nothing and no one was left at all. There aren't even photos of their pre-war life - everything was burned. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians died in the city during Russia's hostilities against Mariupol. We do not even know the exact number of the dead. And we may not find it out. Because Russian troops brought to the city so-called mobile crematoria - special machines for the destruction of human bodies. The occupiers drew conclusions from how the world reacted to the massacre in Bucha. And now the Russians are trying to hide the traces of war crimes. Ladies and Gentlemen! Portuguese people! When we turn to the nations of the free world for help, we say simple and clear things. We need weapons to protect ourselves from the brutal Russian invasion, which brought to our people as much evil as the Nazi invasion did 80 years ago. Leopard tanks, armored personnel carriers, Harpoon anti-ship missiles - you have them and you can help protect the freedom and civilization of Europe with them. Therefore, I appeal to your state to provide us with this assistance. We need increased pressure of sanctions on Russia, because only sanctions can force Russia to seek peace and deprive the Russian military machine of resources. We need the principled stance of European companies, so that all of them leave the Russian market, because their taxes, their excise taxes, which they pay to the Russian budget, support this evil. Why did Russia start the war? The capture of Ukraine is its first step in gaining control of Eastern Europe to destroy democracy in our region. Ukraine has been and remains the mainstay of democratic processes in our region. The two revolutions of 2004 and 2014, which stopped the dictatorship in Ukraine, in fact defended democracy not only for our nation, but also for all the nations of our region who want to freely choose the future, without any coercion - internal and external. And your people who will soon celebrate the anniversary of the Carnation Revolution, which freed you from the dictatorship, clearly understand our feelings. Exactly understands the feelings of all other nations of our region who seek freedom. What does Russia bring to Ukraine? Death and dictatorship. And after Ukraine it will try to bring all this to Moldova, Poland, Georgia, the Baltic states, Kazakhstan and all other countries it can reach. Russia can be stopped. Mass killings, deportation and dictatorship can be stopped. Now, in Ukraine. I am grateful to your government and to all the Portuguese people for the assistance to Ukraine you have already provided. For supporting sanctions against Russia. And it is important now, when the European Union is preparing the sixth package of sanctions, that you show your leadership and defend the need for an oil embargo against Russia at the European level. It is also important that you, along with other EU countries, insist on a complete restriction of the Russian banking system. We need to close all EU ports, all Portuguese ports for Russian ships. In particular, for those that they are trying to hide under other countries’ flags. I am grateful to you for supporting our people, Ukrainian displaced persons. The Ukrainian and Portuguese people know each other well. They understand each other well. And it is important that you use your opportunities, both in Europe and in other macro-regions of the world, to protect the freedom and right to life of our people. You can tell the truth about this Russian invasion, about this war against the Ukrainian people, both in South America and in Africa. I ask you to fight Russian propaganda and Russian corrupt influence in the countries that are close to you. And I believe that the people of Portugal, and with them the Portuguese politicians, will support our state in its fundamental desire to be with you in the European Union. The free must support the free. The decent must support the decent. The conscientious must support the conscientious. And I believe that you will not betray us or yourself. Because Ukraine is already on its way to the European Union under an accelerated procedure. We hope that in the near future we will be able to obtain the status of a candidate for membership in the European Union. And when the decision is considered, I ask you to support full membership for Ukraine. Because you on the western edge of Europe and we on the eastern edge of Europe have the same values, the same view of what life should be like on our continent. Freedom, human rights, the rule of law, equality for every man, for every woman and the opportunity to live freely and without any dictatorship, so that everyone always has the time for happiness and for saudade. Thank you, Portugal! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Free people of the bravest country! The 56th day of our defense is coming to an end, and today we have definitely become one step closer to peace. I was glad to welcome in Kyiv a great friend of our state and all Ukrainians - President of the European Council Charles Michel. Each such visit only underscores how absurd Russia's plans to seize our state were. Three days? Five days? In how many days the occupiers planned to take control of Ukraine? 56 days - and we are meeting our guests in our capital for the sake of our national interests. I held very thorough talks with Charles Michel on many aspects of relations between Ukraine and the European Union. The main thing is, of course, to protect our state and maintain the stable functioning of all state structures and all institutions. We discussed concrete steps of the European Union to help our country. In particular, defensive, financial and sanctions. The second major topic of the talks is our movement towards European integration. This is the historic moment when we can develop maximum speed in joining the European Union. We have already proved that the Ukrainian state and public institutions are effective enough to withstand even the test of war. We are already doing as much to protect freedom on the European continent as other nations have never done. And I see from all our friends in the European Union a willingness to help our movement as much as possible. I thanked Charles for that today. The third major topic of our talks is the preparation of the necessary steps for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. We also discussed what we can do together with the European Union to address the threats to food and energy security in Europe and around the world posed by Russia. Resuming exports of Ukrainian agricultural products and blocking Russia's ability to blackmail Europe with energy resources are top priorities for everyone on the continent. Before meeting with me, President Charles Michel visited Borodyanka, Kyiv region. He came there not alone, but together with his team. They saw with their own eyes what the occupiers had done on our land. What destruction they had caused. And a correct conclusion was made by our friends: there can be no peace without justice. We will do everything we can to bring to justice every Russian military and commander guilty of war crimes. Modern technology allows you to clarify many details. Every surname, every home address, every bank account - we will find everything. A Plan to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation for the war against our state was published today. This Plan was developed by a team of Ukrainian and international experts led by Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul. When all the key areas identified in this Plan are implemented, Russia will lose the opportunity to finance the military machine. In particular, the Plan provides for restrictions on Russia's energy sector, banking sector, export-import operations, transport. The next steps should include an oil embargo and a complete restriction on oil supplies from Russia. We are also working to ensure that all - I emphasize - all Russian officials who support this shameful war receive a logical sanctions response from the democratic world. Russia must be recognized as a state - sponsor of terrorism, and the Russian Armed Forces must be recognized as a terrorist organization. The European Union is currently preparing a sixth package of sanctions. We discussed this today with Charles Michel. We are working to make it truly painful for the Russian military machine and the Russian state as a whole. I emphasize in all negotiations that sanctions are needed not as an end in themselves, but as a practical tool to motivate Russia to seek peace. It is important that the EU Delegation and the embassies of friendly countries resumed work in Kyiv. This is one of the signals needed to tell Russia that there is no alternative to peace. There is no alternative to ending the war and guaranteeing full security for Ukraine. The more diplomatic missions return to work in our capital, the stronger this important signal will be. Already 18 foreign missions are working in Kyiv in various formats. In particular, Italy, Iran, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, the Holy See, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, France, the Czech Republic, Estonia and others. The return to normal life of the liberated cities and communities of Ukraine continues. 934 settlements have already been liberated. Police resumed work in 435 settlements. Local self-government started working in 431 communities. The work of humanitarian headquarters was launched in 361 settlements. We are gradually restoring people's access to medical and educational services, to social protection bodies. We are restoring road infrastructure, electricity, gas and water supply. The biggest threats are mines and tripwire mines planted by the occupiers and shells that did not explode. It takes a lot of time, a lot of effort to neutralize them all. And I am grateful to all the specialists, all the rescuers who perform this important task. Once again, I urge our citizens returning to liberated communities to be very careful. Do not enter the territory that has not yet been inspected. Do not go into the woods yet. If you see anything resembling a mine or a tripwire mine, report it to the police and rescuers immediately. Do not delay or attempt to remove hazardous items yourself. The situation in the east and south of our country remains as severe as possible. The occupiers do not give up trying to gain at least some victory for themselves through a new large-scale offensive. At least something they can ""feed"" their propagandists with. And I am sincerely grateful to each of our defenders, to all the Armed Forces of Ukraine, to all our cities, to all our communities that are resisting the invaders. To those who hold on and with their struggle, without exaggeration, save our state. Mariupol, Avdiivka, Maryinka, Krasnohorivka, Toretsk, Velyka Novosilka, Zolote, Popasna, Izyum, Kharkiv, Hulyaipole, Mykolaiv, Vysokopillya, Snihurivka and dozens, dozens of other cities, dozens of other communities of the east, communities of the south of Ukraine, in the struggle for which the fate of our people and our freedom is being decided. We are doing more than the maximum to ensure the supply of weapons to our army. Every day, all our diplomats, all our representatives and I personally work 24/7 through all possible channels - official and unofficial - to speed up the delivery of aid. And I am very pleased to say, with cautious optimism, that our partners started to understand our needs better. Understand what exactly we need. And when exactly we need all this. Not in weeks, not in a month, but immediately. Right now, as Russia is trying to intensify its attacks. Traditionally, before delivering the address, I signed a decree awarding our defenders. 203 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 49 of them posthumously. Five of our servicemen were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to all who stood up for our state!

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! The 55th day of our defense against Russia's full-scale aggression is coming to an end. At present, virtually the entire combat-ready part of the invaders’ army is concentrated on the territory of our state and in the border areas of Russia. They drove against Ukraine almost everyone and almost everything that can fight us. Therefore, in this confrontation, in this defense, before the eyes of the whole world, we are really opposing the army, which was considered the second or third in power. And the way our Armed Forces are holding on, the way our entire nation is boldly defending itself shows that the Ukrainian army has long deserved to be higher than the Russian one in global rankings. If we had access to all the weapons we need, which our partners have and which are comparable to the weapons used by the Russian Federation, we would have already ended this war. We would have already restored peace and liberated our territory from the occupiers. Because the superiority of the Ukrainian military in tactics and wisdom is quite obvious. That is why I emphasize the simple truth in literally every contact with the leaders of the democratic world, in all negotiations, in all interviews - it is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing somewhere for years. If they have the weapons that Ukraine needs here, needs now, if they have the ammunition that we need here and now, it is their moral duty first of all to help protect freedom. Help save the lives of thousands of Ukrainians. If we had received what we are getting now in the first week of the war, the benefit for Ukraine and for freedom in Europe would be greater, I am sure. And if we get what some partners plan to hand over to Ukraine in the coming weeks right now, it will save the lives of thousands of people. I hope that the partners will hear this thesis and understand that every day matters. Any delay in helping Ukraine gives the occupiers an opportunity to kill more Ukrainians. The intensity of fire by Russian troops in the Kharkiv direction, in Donbas and in the Dnipropetrovsk region has increased significantly. They still consider ordinary housing infrastructure normal targets for them. In this war, the Russian army will forever inscribe itself in world history as perhaps the most barbaric and inhuman army in the world. Purposefully killing civilians, destroying residential neighborhoods, civilian infrastructure, using all kinds of weapons for this, including those prohibited by international conventions, is the signature of the Russian army. And this is vileness, which will mark the Russian state as a source of absolute evil for generations. And when a special tribunal is set up to convict all those guilty of war crimes, a Russian passport will mean only one thing in any country: unequivocal condemnation from all decent people, unequivocal unwillingness to cooperate. The situation in Mariupol remains unchanged - as severe as possible. The Russian army is blocking any efforts to organize humanitarian corridors and save our people. The occupiers are trying to carry out deportation or even mobilization of the local residents who have fallen into their hands. The fate of at least tens of thousands of Mariupol residents who were previously relocated to Russian-controlled territory is unknown. Unfortunately, we do not hear a response from Russia to the exchange offer, which could save the civilians and defenders of Mariupol. And this silence should be noted by all who have been or may be associated with Russia. When your fate is decided, Moscow will be silent. This is illustrative. And this is the best argument not to have contacts with the Russian Federation. In the south of our country, the occupiers are trying to demonstrate at least something that can be presented in Russia as the alleged readiness of Ukrainians to cooperate with Russian structures. It looks pathetic. After 55 days of war, the occupiers didn't manage to attract anyone to their side except for some outcasts. The situation is quite clear - Ukrainians in all regions of our state support Ukrainian national unity. They support our national statehood. And I am grateful to all the residents of the temporarily occupied cities, temporarily occupied communities - Kherson, Kakhovka, Melitopol and all our other communities - for this clear position. No cooperation with the occupiers. No support for the collaborators. The more principled we are, the more principled you will be, the sooner normal life will return. I held a meeting with representatives of the Verkhovna Rada today. We discussed the plan of parliamentary work, agreed on important draft decisions for the state, which need to be adopted in the near future. In particular, the deputies were offered to support the technical decision to extend the martial law. This is necessary for the legal support of the defense of our state and the stable operation of all structures. We also discussed a bill on the procedure for deploying the capacities of the enterprises that were evacuated from the combat zone. A bill with amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code of Ukraine, which are necessary for cooperation with the International Criminal Court. A bill on the legal regime in the temporarily occupied territories. The conversation was substantive, and I hope that the deputies will work out these bills soon enough. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. Informed him about the current situation in the areas of hostilities and especially in Donbas. Expressed gratitude for the strong support for Ukraine. We coordinated the next steps needed to protect our state and freedom in Europe. Agreed to increase the supply of heavy weapons, including armored vehicles. I also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In particular, on the defensive, financial and humanitarian needs of Ukraine. We are accelerating procedures so that Ukraine can move forward in European integration as fast as possible. Now, during the war, this movement and its speed are also elements of protection of our state, preservation of freedom for our people. More and more global companies are announcing the shutdown in Russia. Today, the German company Henkel has joined hundreds of other such large companies. I want to emphasize that this is inevitable: any normal business will have to make such a decision and leave Russia. Now the Russian state is at a level where any association with it and any support for it means complicity in mass killings. Complicity in what will be called crimes against humanity and genocide. Before delivering this address, I signed the traditional decree on awarding our defenders. 286 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 229 of them are servicemen of the 36th separate brigade of marines, which together with other units heroically defends Mariupol. Maximum gratitude from all the Ukrainian people to the 36th brigade, Azov, the 12th brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, border guards, Right Sector volunteers, the 555th military hospital, police officers and territorial defense. Eternal glory to everyone who stood up for Mariupol, our entire state and the people of Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 54th day of our defense against the Russian invasion is coming to an end. The Russian army is not slowing down the use of missiles against Ukraine. Although it should have realized that it will be extremely difficult for it to restore the missile arsenal given even already imposed sanctions. Without imports, they can't even do that. And when all the loopholes used to circumvent sanctions are closed, and when even tougher sanctions are imposed, restoring Russia's missile capabilities will be unrealistic. That is, Russian missile strikes lead to only one thing - missile self-demilitarization of the Russian Federation. A similar process is taking place with other Russian weapons. Producing new artillery, aircraft, new helicopters and cruisers under sanctions will be a daunting task for Russia. None of the missile strikes has changed the situation for Russia tangibly. And if you evaluate them all together, the conclusion will be - this is strategic nonsense. Today's strikes at Lviv, at the Dnipropetrovsk region and any other Russian strikes mean only one thing: we, the world and history will take from Russia much more than Russian missiles will take from Ukraine. Every lost life is an argument for Ukrainians and other free nations to perceive Russia exclusively as a threat generation after generation. And any infrastructure can be restored. And we will definitely do it. In the east and south of our country, the occupiers are recently trying to attack in a little more thought-out manner than before. They are putting pressure, looking for a weak spot in the defense of our state to go there with the main forces... Apparently, Russian generals, accustomed to neglecting any losses, have already killed so many Russian servicemen that even they have to be more careful, as there will be no one left to attack. However, they should not hope this will help them. It is only a matter of time when the whole territory of our state will be liberated. It can now be stated that Russian troops have begun the battle for Donbas, for which they have been preparing for a long time. A very large part of the entire Russian army is now focused on this offensive. No matter how many Russian soldiers are driven there, we will fight. We will defend ourselves. We will do it daily. We will not give up anything Ukrainian, and we do not need what’s not ours. And I am grateful to all our fighters, to all our heroic cities in Donbas, to Mariupol, and also to the cities of the Kharkiv region which are holding on, defending the fate of the whole state, repelling the forces of invaders. Rubizhne, Popasna, Zolote, Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Kramatorsk and all others that have been with Ukraine all these years and forever. I spoke with the President of the Republic of Lithuania and friend of our country Gitanas Nausėda. I informed him about the situation in the combat zones and especially about the situation in Mariupol. We are coordinating our actions to increase Russia's liability for the war. I also spoke with the Prime Ministers of Bulgaria and Croatia. About the threats created by Russia to free navigation in the Black Sea, about our cooperation at the level of the European Union, about the effective support for Ukraine and the development of solutions for the restoration of peace. I held an important meeting today on the post-war reconstruction and development of Ukraine. We need to work out everything in detail already now to be fully prepared when the war is over. We are developing a comprehensive plan that provides for the reconstruction of what’s destroyed, the modernization of state structures and the maximum acceleration of Ukraine's development. It is not just about the amount of physical work - to build housing, restore businesses, attract new businesses that will work to rebuild infrastructure and renew economic relations in our country. It is also about rethinking how our country will develop in the future. What industries can be the basis of growth after the war. What solutions and resources are needed to increase the level of processing in Ukraine and stop selling raw materials, as it was before. Which cities will become the locomotives of economic and technological growth, pulling up the surrounding areas. As of now - if you listen carefully to all the discussions that are taking place in our country at different levels about the post-war reconstruction - the main topic in them is actually about money. What financial package is needed to recover from the war? But I always emphasize that money is not the foundation for the country's development. Ideas, people - that's the foundation. And when there are ideas, when there are our people, you begin to see what money is needed for and in what amount. We need to have a clear vision of this or that branch of our economy, the direction of development we expect from this or that city, the benefits this or that institution can bring to the state as a whole. Of course, for small and medium-sized businesses we must provide the most comfortable and free environment. In terms of taxes and administrative relations. Of course, digitization is a top priority. Security is also a top priority for us. Defensive potential must be at a new level. Of course, judicial, anti-corruption and other important reforms need to be brought to fruition. But all this must work for a concrete vision of what Ukraine will be like. What it will be like a year after the war, 5 years after the war, 10, 20 years after. What exactly will be important for our people. What exactly will be important for global business. How many jobs and in what industries will be available to Ukrainians. Ukraine's accession to the European Union is an integral part of this strategic vision. And in this context, today was a historic event - we are going through one of the stages before joining the EU. We provided answers to a questionnaire received from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and Josep Borrell, Head of European Diplomacy. Each country that joined the European Union went through the same procedure with the questionnaire. The only difference is that it took them years, and we completed it in a little more than a week. We will provide the second part of the answers shortly. And we hope that Europe’s decision in response will be quick. The status of a candidate for membership in the European Union will open for us unprecedented opportunities in our history for the restoration and modernization of Ukraine. We are negotiating with countries at the bilateral level and with international financial institutions to support our country's reconstruction program. Of course, we will involve global business as much as possible. But we are primarily interested in creating jobs and added value in Ukraine. Therefore, localization will continue to be an important process for us. In the evening I signed a traditional decree on awarding our heroes. 192 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 24 of them posthumously.

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! Today, Christians of the Western rite celebrate Easter. The happiest Christian holiday. A holiday of the victory of life over death. The Ukrainian Catholic community unites millions of people. And I sincerely wish everyone peace. I wish you to keep the light of soul even in this dark time of war against our state. To keep it to see how good will soon surely defeat evil for the sake of our country, and how the truth will overcome any lies of the occupiers. A wonderful gift for the holiday was made by our team at the ""Invictus Games"", in which veterans and servicemen take part. On the first day of the competition, which started in the Netherlands, the Ukrainians won ""gold"", ""silver"" and ""bronze"". Rodion Sitdikov won the ""gold"" in the shot put. Artem Lukashuk and Ivan Heretsun brought Ukraine ""silver"" and ""bronze"" in long jump. Thank you guys from all of us, from all Ukrainians! This is always important, and now it is extremely important. To glorify our flag, to perform the Ukrainian national anthem and to honor our heroes. But whatever the day and whatever the holiday, the task remains the same for everyone in power. Work not even one hundred, but two hundred percent to ensure our defense. Provide Ukraine with weapons, financial support and all other supplies. I began this day with a meeting with the military and government officials on the situation in combat zones. Russian troops are preparing for an offensive operation in the east of our country. It will begin in the near future. They want to literally finish off and destroy Donbas. Destroy everything that once gave glory to this industrial region. Just as the Russian troops are destroying Mariupol, they want to wipe out other cities and communities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. We are doing everything to ensure defense. We are in constant contact with partners. We are grateful to those who really help with everything they can. But those who have the weapons and ammunition we need and delay their provision must know that the fate of this battle also depends on them. The fate of people who can be saved. The 53rd day of the war is over, and we have been waiting for answers to some points in our weapons inquiries for 53 days. And some answers are formulated so that delivery can begin only in May. I speak directly in such cases: every delay in weapons, every political delay is a permission for Russia to take the lives of Ukrainians. This is how Russia interprets it. That should not be the case in reality. Constant shelling of our city of Kharkiv continues. Today, Russian troops hit, in particular, the streets of Culture, Shevchenko and Darwin. Apparently, these are especially dangerous words for Russia - ""culture"", ""Shevchenko"", ""Darwin"". This is something that threatens its existence. As of this moment, the list of dead from this strike includes five Kharkiv residents and at least 15 wounded. In the last four days alone, 18 people have been killed and 106 have been wounded by the Russian shelling of Kharkiv. This is nothing but deliberate terror. Mortars, artillery against ordinary residential neighborhoods, against ordinary civilians. The democratic world must also react to what the occupiers are doing in the south of Ukraine - in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Torture chambers are built there. They abduct representatives of local authorities and anyone deemed visible to local communities. They blackmail teachers. They steal money provided for paying pensions. Humanitarian aid is blocked and stolen. They create starvation. The occupiers are also trying to tear off the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, following the example of the so-called DPR and LPR. This territory is being transferred to the ruble zone and subordinated to the administrative machine of Russia. All this requires greater speed from Western countries in preparing a new powerful package of sanctions. The answer to the attempted ""ruble occupation"" of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions must be full coverage of the Russian banking and financial systems by sanctions. Because they are part of the occupation machine. Of course, the need for an embargo on oil supplies from Russia is growing every day. Everyone in Europe and America already sees Russia openly using energy to destabilize Western societies. Russia's bet on chaos in fuel markets should not succeed. And today I really want to support once again all those who are fighting for Ukraine in the cities and communities of the south of our state. Who protect our national symbols. Who protect our freedom. Every manifestation of such a struggle makes it difficult for the occupiers to carry out their task. Sabotage the orders of the occupiers. Do not cooperate with them. Protest. It is necessary to hold on so that Russia does not manage to distort life in other cities of Ukraine, like it did in Donetsk and Luhansk. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal reported today on the implementation of the order on additional social assistance due to the war. First. Every displaced person can receive financial assistance for living. Every month it is 2 thousand hryvnias for an adult and 3 thousand hryvnias for a child. It is possible to apply for this in the nearest administrative services center, bodies of social protection, and starting from Wednesday - in ""Diia"". Second. People are being evacuated from the war-torn areas. The government is deploying special locations to ensure temporary accommodation for people and provide financial assistance immediately at railway and bus stations. Third. Applications for destroyed or damaged housing are being collected through ""Diia"". Be sure to apply if you have lost an apartment, house or if they have been damaged by shelling. Fourth. I urge employers, no matter how difficult it may be, to try to employ displaced persons. Now every job saved and every extra job is helping protect the state in war. For each displaced person whom the business hires, the company will receive co-financing of labor costs from the state. This is 6,500 hryvnias. The application can also be submitted on the ""Diia"" portal. Traditionally in the evening I signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 188 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 553 warriors of the National Guard. 64 border guards. 5 police officers, 26 employees of the State Emergency Service. 6 defenders of Ukraine were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. And finally. Another congratulation - also for our heroes, for Ukrainian firefighters. Today is the Day of Firefighters. And I sincerely congratulate everyone who protects the security of our people, our land from fire. Who is at war almost every day even in peacetime. Thank you for your service! Thank you for saving us! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear free people of the most beautiful country! A country that has a future. That's true. This is what motivates us to fight now. On the battlefield and around the clock on the diplomatic, information and economic fronts. This is what allows us to plan our lives after the war. Our Ukrainian free, sovereign and democratic future. Definitely – peaceful. Definitely – with development. Today I held a meeting dedicated to the reconstruction of our cities. Of course, this is a huge amount of work. But still less than defending the state in war. Than that we all – all Ukrainians, our army and all our people – are already really doing. So don't be afraid of the scale. What is important in our project of reconstruction of Ukraine? The task is not only to physically rebuild the houses, apartments, bridges and roads, businesses and social infrastructure that were destroyed by Russian troops. Not just to give people back everything they lost and give them a new foundation in life. Now it is a historic moment. The moment when we can solve many old problems of the whole environment of our life once and for all. When we can make quality urban planning where it did not exist. We can take into account real traffic flows. Guarantee energy saving, environmental friendliness of materials, inclusiveness. This is when it comes to the organization of living space and the quality of reconstruction. But there is also justice. Housing queues have existed for decades and never ended. This has been the case since Soviet times. Millions of people know how difficult it is to get a home, earn money for their own apartment, build a house. It has always been especially painful for the military, law enforcement, and public sector workers. For those who work for society and receive very little from the state for it. Last year, I set a task for the government – to do everything possible to provide all veterans, who were waiting in line, with housing this year. Next, we planned to provide all our military with housing. And now we are actually expanding last year's task to the whole state and refining it so that it would be a real modernization of Ukrainian cities and Ukrainian communities. And we combine this with the housing energy modernization program. As a result, there will be several stages. Today, I set a task to provide temporary housing to all our IDPs at the first stage. Those whose house was destroyed by war. Temporary housing until we rebuild their homes. Or until people receive compensation in square meters or money. In the second stage, we restore what the occupiers tried to destroy. All affected cities and communities. And at the third stage, we provide housing for all those who have defended or are defending the state, who have worked or are working in the interests of society, and do not have their own housing. It can no longer be the case that a person devotes his whole life to military service, but retires without having his own apartment. It can no longer be the case that a son or daughter is defending Ukraine in the war, and a father and mother do not have their own housing and are forced to live in a rented apartment or look for other options. It can no longer be the case that a doctor or nurse, teacher or law enforcement officer spends his whole life honestly and stays in a dormitory for decades, if not for life. The government, all central authorities together with local authorities must ensure this. And they will ensure. Everyone in Ukraine has the right to their own housing, their own home or their own apartment. The right to a safe and comfortable living space that will be designed for anyone. All those whose homes were destroyed by the occupiers, and all those who were waiting in line for many years. All our people who deserve to live in a modern environment. To implement this project, we are already involving leading architects, the full potential of the state and international support. The participation of companies, partner countries, international donors can be added. I have absolutely no doubt that we will be able to do this. It will be possible not only to restore that was destroyed, but also to restore justice for those whose right to housing has been violated. We also discussed the issue of memorializing what Ukrainians experienced during this war. They discussed how to preserve parts of this experience so that it would always remind all generations of our people of the brutal and senseless invasion Ukraine has been able to fend off. As one of the examples, a project of a memorial complex is being prepared, which will tell the story of the destroyed bridge in Kyiv region, which connected Irpin and Bucha with Kyiv. The story of people, who escaped from Russian invaders to Kyiv using this bridge and this road. I met today with servicemen of the State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection. I handed over awards. The contribution of special communications servicemen to our defense, to our path to victory and peace, cannot be overestimated. Their work should be mentioned more often, they should be thanked more loudly. Since the first day of the war, we have had stable communication both within our country and with Ukraine's partner states. I am sincerely grateful to everyone who provides it! I spoke today with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and Prime Minister of Sweden Magdalena Andersson. On defense and other support for Ukraine. On toughening the sanctions policy against Russia. On the situation in various areas of hostilities in Ukraine, and especially on Mariupol. And about options to help city defenders and civilians. The situation in Mariupol remains as severe as possible. Just inhuman. This is what the Russian Federation did. Deliberately did. And deliberately continues to destroy cities. Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol. There are only two ways to influence this. Or the partners will give Ukraine all the necessary heavy weapons, planes, and, without exaggeration, immediately. So that we can reduce the pressure of the occupiers on Mariupol and unblock it. Or – a negotiating path, in which the role of partners should also be decisive. I want to be heard right now: there has not been a single day since the blockade of Mariupol that we have not sought a solution. Military or diplomatic – anything to save people. But finding this solution is extremely difficult. So far, there is no one hundred percent valid option. This applies to both military options and the negotiation process. Although we have heard many intentions from those who wanted to help and who really in positions of international influence, none of them have been realized yet. However, we will not abandon these efforts. And every day either I, or Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valeriy Zaluzhny, or other military, or head of our negotiating team David Arakhamia – in touch with our defenders of Mariupol. Every day. Traditionally, before the evening address, I signed a decree on awarding our defenders. 186 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 13 servicemen of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Two officers of the Security Service of Ukraine. And one fighter of the National Guard. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! I am sure that you periodically see in the media - Ukrainian and Western - reports on how long this war can last. Some say a few weeks. Others - several years. Some say the war will last until the end of this year. And someone advises to prepare for a permanent confrontation with Russia as long as it exists. Of course, I also hear different predictions. I have much more information than some media outlets about the intentions and capabilities of the Russian army. About the potential of the Russian economy. About the emotional state of society in Russia. All this must be taken into account before saying how long the war will last. Therefore, we must take into account the effectiveness of instruments of influence on Russia used by Ukraine and our entire anti-war coalition against Russia's aggression. The success of our military on the battlefield is really significant. Historically significant. But not enough to clean our land from the occupiers yet. We’ll beat them more. Sanctions against Russia are very significant. Economically painful. But still not enough for the Russian military machine to be left without means of subsistence. We promote stronger, more destructive ones. So, in fact, it is these two areas that determine how long this war will last. I always tell all our partners with whom I discuss this issue that the amount of support for Ukraine directly affects the restoration of peace. It literally defines how many more Ukrainians the occupiers will manage to kill. If someone says: year or years, I answer: you can make the war much shorter. The more and the sooner we get all the weapons we have requested, the stronger our position will be and the sooner peace will come. The more and the sooner we get the financial support we have requested, the sooner there will be peace. The sooner the democratic world recognizes that the oil embargo against Russia and the complete blockade of its banking sector are necessary steps towards peace, the sooner the war will end. So the number one task is to speed up the restoration of peace. Our Armed Forces are doing it brilliantly. They are repelling the occupiers' attacks. They are carrying out counterattacks. They have already tormented - in the true sense of the word - Russian conventional aviation so much that they are forced to use strategic long-range aircraft. I am grateful to each of our defenders for this great work. Our diplomats must continue their activity in all possible directions, at all possible levels. Both official and unofficial. The next package of sanctions against Russia must include an abandonment of Russian oil. In general, the democratic world must admit that money for Russian energy resources is in fact money for the destruction of democracy. When these decisions are made, we will all be able to see that peace is approaching. I held a meeting with government officials today. The key topic is the solution of urgent economic issues that arose during martial law. It was noted that four-fifths of all Ukrainian enterprises have already returned to work in a safe area. In particular, this applies to heavy industry enterprises. Transport networks are being rebuilt. Good performance is shown in trade and services. And all this is also the fulfillment of the national task of accelerating the restoration of peace. That is why I am grateful to everyone who keeps jobs, who employs our people, who helps businesses adapt to these difficult conditions and gives Ukraine the necessary economic strength to live. No matter what, in all cities and communities where there are no occupiers and hostilities, it is necessary to restore the economy to the maximum. Energy issues and the end of this heating season were discussed. The season was successful in spite of everything. Despite all the predictions, tariffs have not increased. There were no rolling blackouts. Supplies were not disrupted even in wartime. Preparations have also begun for the next heating season. We discussed the purchase of gas, the purchase of coal. We offer at least for the next 6 months the electricity tariff in the amount of 1 hryvnia 44 kopecks per kilowatt for those who use less than 250 kilowatts. This is 80% of our people. The Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food reported that the sowing campaign has begun and continues in all regions of our country, including Luhansk and Donetsk. We also talked to government officials today about filling in the questionnaire that Ukraine received from President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. This is a necessary stage in the preparation of our country to become a candidate for EU membership. The work is almost complete, and we will soon provide the answers to the representatives of the European Union. I held an important meeting today with all the leaders of the state power bloc. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Chief of the General Staff, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Commander of the National Guard, Minister of Internal Affairs, Head of the Security Service of Ukraine. The meeting was also attended by the Head of the President's Office, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council and the head of our delegation at the negotiations. The main topic is Mariupol. Details cannot be made public at the moment. But we are doing everything to save our people. The restoration of normal life in those areas and districts where the occupiers were expelled continues. The amount of work is really huge. 918 settlements of different scales, but equally important for us, for Ukraine, have already been de-occupied. We carry out demining. We restore the supply of electricity, water and gas. We restore the work of the police, post office, state and local authorities. Humanitarian headquarters have started working on the territory of 338 liberated settlements. We are resuming the provision of regular and emergency medical care, the work of educational institutions - where it is really possible. In total, on this day, Russian troops have destroyed or damaged 1,018 educational institutions across our country. Restoration of roads and railways has begun. In particular, from tomorrow the railway connection with Chernihiv and Nizhyn will be restored. Trains are already running between the cities of the Sumy region. The teams of Ukravtodor and Ukrzaliznytsia work quite efficiently, and I am grateful to them for this speed. For giving people back a sense of normal life, which the occupiers tried to destroy forever. In the south and east of our country, the situation is still very difficult, far from talking about recovery. In the occupied districts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, the Russian military continue to terrorize civilian residents of our country. They are looking for anyone who has ever been associated with the Ukrainian army or government agencies. The occupiers think that this will somehow make it easier for them to control the territory. But they are wrong. They deceive themselves. The problem of the occupiers is not that they are not accepted by some activists, veterans or journalists. Russia's problem is that the entire Ukrainian people does not accept it and will never accept it again. Russia lost Ukraine forever. Actually, it lost the whole world. It will not be accepted anywhere anymore. And the cruelty with which Russian troops are trying to conquer the Azov, Donbas, Kharkiv regions, only takes away even the slightest chance of these territories and these people to have any ties with this state at least sometime in the future. Maybe somewhere in Russia cruelty is respected. But in Ukraine cruelty is despised. And punished. And it is obligatory. Today I signed decrees on awarding our military. 237 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 34 of them posthumously. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Colonel Kashchenko Dmytro Valeriyovych, commander of the 58th separate motorized infantry brigade of the Operational Command ""North"" of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For the personal example of heroism that inspires comrades in service, for extremely effective combat operations and concrete and very important results for maintaining the positions of our army and expelling the occupiers. And finally. The important words that hope always wins even under seemingly insurmountable circumstances. This Saturday, the Jewish community celebrates Passover. Holiday of liberation. Holiday of life. I sincerely wish all those who celebrate in Ukraine and in the world peace, good and the inevitable defeat of any evil that threatens freedom and life on earth. Chag Pesach Sameach! I am grateful to all our male defenders! I am grateful to all our female defenders! Glory to Ukraine!

Unbreakable people of the bravest country! We have withstood 50 days already. 50 days of Russian invasion, although the occupiers gave us a maximum of five. That's how they ""know us"". That's how they ""make friends with reality."" Russia did not start the war against Ukraine on February 24. Russian troops came to us in 2014. They captured our Crimea. They turned it into a large military base. They made the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov one of the most dangerous seas on the planet. They started a terrible, absolutely cynical war in our Donbas. They have been killing our people for 8 years. 14 thousand were killed during this time! How did the world respond to this? The question remained rhetorical. But that is why they decided they could afford a full-scale war. Some are still debating the severity of sanctions against the Russian Federation. But what is there to discuss when Russian troops are already repeating on our land what Europe saw only during World War II? During the 50 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, they showed that Donbas is the main target for Russia. It is Donbas that Russia wants to destroy in the first place. It is the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that Russian troops are destroying as if they want only stones to be left. And no people to be left at all. They forcibly recruit residents of these areas into their army. They throw them into the worst battles, literally in the frontal of our defense. They are destroying the cities and villages of Donbas. They burn everything that endured eight years of that war. For 80 years, proud and tidy Kharkiv has not seen such torments that Russia has brought to it. Why do they destroy it? What can be achieved by burning Kharkiv? What exactly can destruction on Saltivka or on Freedom Square give to Russia? And these are no longer rhetorical questions. This is a question of how absurd this invasion of the Russian Federation is. How suicidal it is for everything that Russia allegedly ""protects"". For Russian culture, for relations with this nation, even for the Russian language. Russia is burning all this with its weapons. For decades at least. For generations. Ancient Chernihiv. Which is over a thousand years old. Which saw so many wars and so many invaders that at least in the XXI century it deserved peace and tranquility. But... Russia came. Came with the worst that Chernihiv has experienced since the X century. Since the period of Rus’ relation to which Russia once claimed. Now this myth is also burned. Rus’ would not destroy itself. Strangers did that to it. Horde and other invaders. That's who came to our land today. And they are fighting in the same way - for the sake of looting and for the sake of torture. Thank God, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our people, we defended most of our country. I remember the first day of the invasion of the Russian Federation. I remember what I was told on February 24. In particular, the strong of this world. To put it mildly, no one was sure that we would withstand it. Everyone sympathized. Many of them advised me to flee the country. Advised to actually surrender to tyranny. But they didn't know us either. And they did not know how brave Ukrainians are, how much we value freedom. Our opportunity to live the way we want. Not the people who rule in such a way that their army sees toilets for the first time in their lives in the occupied territories and steals even ordinary household appliances. The occupiers will be responsible for everything they have done in Ukraine. For everything they did to Ukrainians. They will be responsible for Bucha, Kramatorsk, Volnovakha, Okhtyrka. For Hostomel and Borodyanka. For Izyum, for Mariupol and all other cities and communities of Ukraine, which the Russian army pulled back to the period 80 years ago. To that terrible time, about which everyone in the world has always said: ""Never again."" Here it is again. Here it is now. And we will do everything to make it truly the last. Because the question ""How to guarantee security for Ukraine and for Europe?"" will never be rhetorical again. We will not allow this. I am grateful to everyone who supported our state. Who immediately asked how they could help. Who stood with us back to back and helped us get what is necessary for the defense of our state. This period, these 50 days have shown me many world leaders in a different way. Different states. I have seen great generosity in those who are not rich themselves. I have seen the extraordinary determination of those who were not taken seriously by global leaders. I have seen that the democratic world does have those whose will is enough to protect freedom from the onslaught of tyranny. I have seen politicians behaving as if they had no power. And I have seen non-politicians who did more in these 50 days than some statesmen who claimed leadership. But all that is just an add-on. An add-on for how Ukraine is defended by our people, all our people. Those who stopped the advance of endless columns of Russian equipment. Those who rebuff constant attacks in Donbas. Those who heroically defend Mariupol, helping our entire state to withstand. Those who stopped the offensive from the south. And made our Chornobaivka famous. Those who drove the enemy out of the north. Those who have shown that Russian aviation is defenseless, even though Russia has spent tens of billions of dollars on various systems to protect its aircraft. Those who have shown that Russian ships can go... to the bottom only. Those who help the army and society find everything they may need. Those who save, heal, those who teach. Conduct mine clearance. Who provide us all with a stable connection. Those who rebuilt supply chains for the whole country. Those who maintain financial stability, who saved the business and continued to work. Those who help the displaced persons. Those who started the sowing campaign. Those who give Ukraine the correct information and the necessary emotions. All our journalists, all those who united for the national telethon. 50 days of our defense is an achievement. Achievement of millions of Ukrainians. Everyone who made the main decision in life on February 24 - to fight. To be human. Not to give up. And not to betray. From time immemorial to the present day, mankind has been looking for heroes. People always appreciate heroes. They always support those who are brave. And always feel who is fighting for the good. During the 50 days of this war, Ukraine became a hero for the whole free world. For those who have the courage to call a spade a spade. For those who are not poisoned by propaganda. You have all become heroes. All Ukrainian men and women who withstood and do not give up. And who will win. Who will return peace to Ukraine. I'm sure of it. I spoke today with our team, which will take part in the Invictus Games international sports competition. Among them are both veterans and servicemen who are currently defending our state. They are deeply concerned that they had to go to the competition. I assured them that we will wait for their return and will support them in the competition just as sincerely. I believe that our team will make us proud of it this year as well. And traditionally, as every evening, I signed decrees on awarding those who excelled in the defense of the state. 221 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 34 of them posthumously. And two employees of the State Special Communications Service of Ukraine. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Major Kukurba Oleksandr Vasyliovych, chief of intelligence of the 299th tactical aviation brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thanks to his courageous actions, dozens of enemy equipment units and hundreds of occupiers were destroyed. I also awarded those whose surnames cannot be told. But I awarded them for what is definitely good for everyone. Eternal glory to all who defend the state! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Indomitable people of the bravest country! Today was a useful day for our state, for our defense against the Russian offensive. The presidents of four states - friends of Ukraine - arrived in Kyiv. Those who help us from the first days. Who did not hesitate to give us weapons. Who did not doubt whether to impose sanctions. And who is now at the level of the European Union pushing for a tougher sanctions package against the Russian Federation. Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia. I was very glad to meet with the presidents today. The negotiations were fruitful. It is important that the presidents visited Borodyanka in the Kyiv region, where they saw with their own eyes what the occupiers had done. For the presidents, this is another argument to push harder for tangible sanctions against Russia. First of all, we need an oil embargo. And Europe's clear readiness to give up all Russian energy. The European Union must stop sponsoring Russia's military machine. Western sanctions policy was also discussed today by a group of international experts led by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak. The group has been working for three weeks. It consists of international and Ukrainian experts who assess the sanctions imposed and how Russia is trying to circumvent them. The group has prepared concrete proposals on how to remove sanctions loopholes, which are constantly used by Russia, and how to immediately enhance sanctions to make it tangible for Moscow. I spoke today with US President Biden. The topics of the conversation included the prosecution of all Russian servicemen and commanders who committed war crimes. International cooperation for this. A new package of defensive support for Ukraine was discussed. The agreement was reached. $ 800 million. Weapons, ammunition, other assistance. Artillery systems, armored personnel carriers, helicopters. Sincere gratitude for your support! We also agreed to enhance sanctions against Russia. I addressed the Parliament and the people of Estonia. Expressed gratitude for the help provided to Ukraine, including weapons. I also called on Estonia to join the project of Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. We are already cooperating with Estonia in the field of digitization. And after the war it could become an even bigger project. On restoration of government and business digital systems, on cybersecurity. On restoration of the relevant educational institutions. Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan visited Bucha. It is right that a group of forensic experts from the International Criminal Court will start working in the city. Responsibility for the Russian military for war crimes is inevitable. We will drag them all to the tribunal. And not only for what was done in Bucha. In general, in the north of our country, in the liberated areas, mine clearance continues. The occupiers left tens of thousands of unexploded shells, mines and tripwire mines - a lot of everything. Therefore, everyone who wants to return home to the liberated territory should be as careful as possible, as attentive as possible. And immediately inform the police and rescuers in case you find a strange object, an explosive object. Combat reports for today do not differ significantly from previous ones. Russian troops are stepping up activity in the eastern and southern directions. They are trying to retaliate for their defeats. Rocket bombings and artillery strikes continue. New columns of equipment are being brought in. They are looking for reserves. They are trying to recruit residents of the south of our country - that is, from these temporarily occupied areas in addition to the so-called mobilization in certain districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. All this feverish activity of the occupiers testifies first of all to their insecurity. To the fact that even with significant stocks of Soviet military equipment and a significant number of soldiers, whom the commanders do not spare at all, the Russian troops doubt their ability to break us, to break Ukraine. Well, we do everything to justify their doubts. And I am grateful to all our defenders who hold positions and teach Russian soldiers to think that this war against Ukraine can only end in Russia's strategic defeat - sooner or later. Either the Russian leadership will really seek peace, or as a result of this war, Russia will leave the international arena forever. And before delivering this address, as always, I signed decrees to award our defenders. 270 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 7 of them posthumously. 11 employees of the State Protection Department were also awarded. Another decree awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to 2 servicemen of our Armed Forces. Posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine!

0,"Members of the Government! Dear deputies of the Riigikogu! The people of Estonia! Thank you for the opportunity to address you today. In circumstances that take us all back to the darkest times of the 20th century. For thirty years, the nations of Europe have enjoyed peace, freedom and shared opportunities for development. Now, Russian revanchism has destroyed all the good that has worked for decades for peace in Europe, for the stability of life of European nations. Only fragments of the global security architecture are left. The same ruins as from Ukrainian cities bombed by Russian missiles and aircraft. All the international institutions that are supposed to support peace - the UN, the OSCE and others - are not able to stop Russia's aggression right now. Although this is what they were created for. Regional alliances, and above all NATO, have faced a difficult reality when no one can be 100% sure whether they will really protect their members in the event of a large-scale Russian attack. The same as the attack on Ukraine. Or in the event of an even worse attack - with the use of weapons of mass destruction. For the first time in many years, the threat of Russia's use of chemical or even nuclear weapons has to be taken seriously. Russian state propagandists, clearly guided by the relevant ""theme lists"", openly discuss Russia's ability to seize all neighboring European countries. They talk about it not just for the sake of emotions, but systematically accustom the Russian audience to the fact that war against neighbors is supposed to be the norm. Russia's attempt to seize all of Ukraine after 8 years of war in Donbas has brought back to European reality what your people had to go through. Mass deportations, filtration camps, a consistent attempt to destroy all those who support the national idea. Today, more than 500,000 Ukrainians have been forcibly displaced. Just imagine how much it is! This is as if the occupiers set, sorry for the example, the goal of deporting all people from Tallinn. The whole city - it was and now there is no one. A third of all your citizens. Deported Ukrainians are deprived of documents. Their phones are being confiscated. They are trying to take these people to remote regions of the Russian Federation. Attempts to return to Ukraine are being hindered in every possible way. Children are separated from their parents and there are attempts of their illegal adoption in Russian families... Tens of thousands of people have already been killed in Ukrainian cities affected by Russian strikes. The Russian army uses all kinds of artillery, all kinds of missiles and air bombs against residential areas and civilian infrastructure. In particular, phosphorus bombs and other munitions prohibited by international law. This is an obvious terror against the civilian population. It is an attempt to break the morale of the people, to subdue Ukrainians for generations or simply to destroy them. Why does the Russian leadership allow themselves all this? What ensures a sense of impunity for Moscow? I'm sure you know the answer to these questions. It is obvious. On the one hand, Russia enjoys its privileges in international structures. In particular, the seat occupied by it as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to block any attempts to actually return peace to Europe or other regions where Russia wages a war. Exactly Russia. On the other hand, the Russian leadership absolutely does not believe that Europe can bring Russia to justice. Moscow simply does not believe that Europe can force Russia into peace. They expect a split among Europeans and that the priority of maintaining trade for Europeans will be higher than the priority of security or even the priority of survival of Russia's neighboring nations. Ladies and Gentlemen! The people of Estonia! This is the time when we can either stop Russia or lose the whole of Eastern Europe for a very long time. Lose any hope for a safe and free life on the continent governed by universally recognized law not by force. And I thank you for understanding that. A crowded rally on February 26 with the participation of tens of thousands of Estonians in the heart of ancient Tallinn on Vabaduse Square in support of Ukraine and in support of freedom in Europe has already become a glorious page of our common history. Estonia was one of the first to provide Ukraine with the necessary assistance, this is true, including defensive aid. I am grateful to you for the sincere support of our migrants. You have been and remain exemplary in your consideration of the issues of Russia's war against Ukraine and the relevant sanctions policy in European and other international structures. I am grateful to you for abandoning Russian energy. The source of dollars and euros paid to Russia for oil and gas, which makes it self-confident and unwilling to seek equal relations with other nations. But we all need to do much more to stop Europe's immersion in the evil that the continent saw in the 1940s! In the same occupation that your country, by the way, went through as well. The black pages of history should not be repeated when deported Ukrainians and Estonians remained for many years in Siberia or the Russian Far East. There are already more than enough Ukrainian and Estonian graves - graves of those who died from communist deportations. That is why I urge you at the level of the European Union to find such instruments of influence on Russia, such instruments of pressure that could stop deportations and return all deported people home. The European Union has the power to ensure this. The European Union must use this power. Until Russia returns forcibly deported Ukrainians, until it returns thousands of abducted children, it must not receive any money from European states or companies. The European Union has no right to sponsor deportations. The European Union has no right to sponsor war. The policy of sanctions against the Russian Federation needs to be taken even more seriously. Why are sanctions necessary? Because this is the only tool to force Russia into peace. I urge you to defend the need for a complete blockade of Russian banks when approving a new, very important package of sanctions against the Russian Federation at the EU level. All banks, not just part of them. I urge you to finally add oil to the sanctions package. An embargo is needed at the level of the entire European Union! I also invite your state and your specialists to join the work of the joint group set up to investigate the war crimes of the Russian army on the territory of independent Ukraine. Technical and expert support is indispensable now as the number of war crimes already reaches tens of thousands. These are executions of civilians, torture, rape, blowing up hospitals, bombing maternity hospitals, burning food warehouses, artillery shelling of shelters in which children are hiding, and they knew about it - I emphasize that once again... There is no crime that Russian soldiers have not committed in the 49 days of this invasion. We will definitely investigate all these war crimes, identify all the culprits and find them. No matter how long it will take. But if we do it together with you, together with other European countries, we will be able to do it much faster. Keep in mind that most of Stalin's torturers didn’t bear responsibility for everything they did. Therefore, it is especially important to bring to justice a new generation of Russian executioners. And this must be done now - for what they have done in Ukraine. So that they do not have to be searched for war crimes against the Baltic nations, against Finland, Poland or any other country. All those who have already gained freedom in the 20th century must preserve it in the 21st century. Ukraine will always be grateful to Estonia for the principled support of our state in European integration. I am grateful to you for realizing that Ukraine's accession to the European Union is not just a question of economics or some abstract policy. It is a question of security and guarantees for the preservation of freedom and democracy in Central and Eastern Europe. Ukraine must receive the status of a candidate for EU membership in the near future. We must think about the post-war reconstruction of our country already now. When Russia loses, and this will inevitably happen, it will be necessary to prove to Russia and all other potential revanchists in the world that the war will not lead to the realization of their plans. We are already cooperating with your country in the field of digitization, we are already demonstrating to other European countries the advantages of modern digital systems, including in public administration. After the war, it will become even more relevant, I'm sure. For restoring the normal functioning of state institutions and local authorities. For the return of companies. For the cyber defense of Ukraine and the whole, I repeat - the whole of Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! The people of Estonia! Such visits to the capital of our state are especially important now. They are important not only for us, not only as evidence of European support for our struggle for freedom. But also as evidence that all European defenders of freedom will continue to be united. Without any political or economic ""bows"" to Russia. Europeans must make every effort to restore international law immediately. To immediately force Russia to seek peace. This task can only be done jointly by everyone in Europe. At the level of the whole European Union. Together with other members of our anti-war coalition. If Europe wastes time, Russia will use it to expand the war zone to other countries. I believe that together we will never allow this. Thank you, Estonia! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Unbreakable people of the bravest country! Do you remember how Russia bragged that they would seize Kyiv in 48 hours? Instead, Ukraine has been repelling the enemy for 48 days. Today it is worth remembering. It is worth remembering that the Russian leadership expected to see the parade of occupiers on Khreschatyk a few days after February 24, after the beginning of the invasion. Instead they see orderly ranks of occupiers every day, whom our defenders send to hell. In 48 hours, which stretched for 48 days, the Russian army has reached a level of irreparable losses higher than that of the Soviet Union in 10 years of war in Afghanistan. Higher than that of Russia in the two wars in Chechnya. The general list of ""two hundred"" for Russia will soon reach 20,000. Literally in a few days, if not tonight. And then what? 30 thousand killed? 40 thousand? Today in Russia it was once again stated that their so-called ""special operation"" is supposedly going according to the plan. But, to be honest, no one in the world understands how such a plan could even emerge. How could a plan providing for the death of tens of thousands of your own soldiers in a little more than a month of war emerge? Who could approve such a plan? And what is the final level of their own losses acceptable for this person? Dozens or even hundreds of thousands of dead Russians? Obviously, no one in Moscow cares about the number of Ukrainian civilians killed. They say they do everything for the sake of the people, for the sake of Donbas... But even during World War II, Donbas did not see such cruelty in such a short time. And from whom? From Russian troops. In Donbas, the story of the siege of Leningrad was repeated. What for? What would the people who died or almost died in Leningrad during the Nazi blockade say about this? What would they say about the blockade of Mariupol? It was also stated in Russia today that the massacre committed by the Russian military in Bucha was allegedly a ""staging"". For some reason, the massacres in Borodyanka, Hostomel, Makariv, cities and villages of the Chernihiv region, Kharkiv region and Donbas have not been commented on yet. There are not as many ""specialists in staging"" in the world as there are murderers in the Russian army. Responsibility for war crimes is inevitable. As an example, I can mention today's result of the Security Service of Ukraine. He has been hiding for 48 days. And finally decided to try to escape from our country. Well, for this ""astronaut"" - in the bad sense of the word - the famous ""Let's go!"" did not work. I think it is especially cynical of him to use military camouflage. He tried to disguise himself like that. Such a ""soldier"". Such a ""patriot"". Well, if Medvedchuk chose a military uniform for himself, he falls under the rules of wartime. I offer the Russian Federation to exchange this guy of yours for our boys and our girls who are now in Russian captivity. It is therefore important that our law enforcement officials and military also consider this possibility. There are more and more testimonies and other official data of the investigation about the horrible crimes of the occupiers in the areas where they managed, unfortunately, to come. About the inhuman cruelty of the Russian military towards women and children. About numerous rapes. Not all serial rapists reached the level of brutality of Russian soldiers. Of course, we will establish the full truth about all these savages. No matter how much time and effort it takes, we will find them all. And let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone. We take with great attention yesterday's reports on the use of a projectile with a poisonous substance in Mariupol against the defenders of the city. It is not yet possible to draw one hundred percent conclusions about what kind of substance it was. Obviously it is impossible to conduct a full investigation and full analysis in the besieged city. However, given the repeated threats of Russian propagandists to use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol and the repeated use by the Russian army of phosphorus munitions in Ukraine for example, the world must respond now. Respond preventively. Because after the use of weapons of mass destruction, any response will not change anything. And it will only look like a humiliation for the democratic world. Today, in my address to the parliament and the people of Lithuania, and at the same time to all European nations, I stressed that the sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia must include oil. Stop multiplying insufficiently strong sanctions packages. In any case, you will have to acknowledge that only Europe's abandonment of Russia's energy resources and the complete restriction of Russia's banking system can be an argument for Russia's leadership to seek peace. Without this, Moscow is looking for a military solution. I also spoke today with Chancellor of Austria Nehammer who had met with the Russian leader the day before. We exchanged details about this meeting. Many people like to mock the occupiers, troll their failures, the level of training of their soldiers and the questionable quality of the ""latest"" Russian equipment, which has been developed over the past 20 years and is inferior to Soviet models. And rightly so. That's fair. But at the same time, we must understand that not all Russian tanks are stalled in the field. Not all enemy soldiers simply flee the battlefield. And not all of them are conscripts who do not know how to hold weapons properly. This does not mean we should be afraid of them. This means we must not belittle the merits of our soldiers, our army. And I want to thank them again, all our defenders. I don't get tired of doing it. And I want you and I not to tire of telling them the most important thing: we believe in you. We are proud of you. We admire you. We are also proud of all our people who take to the streets despite the occupation. Who are protesting. Who are expelling the occupiers as best they can. We are proud of all our people! That is why it should always be emphasized that if our cities and villages are occupied, it is only temporary. And they will definitely be liberated. They will be liberated by our heroes. And not only by force of arms, but also by force of morale. Morale demonstrated almost daily by Ukrainian men and women in the cities and villages of the south of our country. In the areas that Russian troops have temporarily occupied and which our army has not yet liberated. No matter what, you need to resist the occupiers. It's hard, I know. You have to fight. Protest. Defend our national statehood. And it is necessary to punish collaborators. Let them make ""KhNR"" somewhere in Khakassia, not in our native Ukrainian Kherson. The future of Ukraine directly depends on the strength of our resistance in all its forms. The future of us all, each of our cities, each of our villages. And I am grateful to everyone who understands this. Who does not stop resisting even when it seems that the result is very far. Because the darkest time is always before dawn. And today I want to separately address those heroes who are having a very hard time. Those who defend Mariupol. Marine battalion of the 36th marine brigade, Azov special operations detachment, 12th operational brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine. Subdivisions of the State Border Guard Service. Volunteers of the ""Right Sector"". 555th military hospital and National Police employees. All the military who are fighting in the JFO area, who are defending Kharkiv, the Kharkiv region, all the military groups defending the Zaporizhzhia region, defending the south. Special thanks to the 92nd, 93rd, 95th brigades. Personally to General Nayev. I am infinitely grateful to everyone! On behalf of all Ukrainians. A few minutes ago I signed three decrees. 419 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards. 72 of them posthumously. Also, 30 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine were awarded state awards. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Dmytro Mykolayovych Vasyliyev, commander of the missile division of the 19th missile brigade. Posthumously. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Inevitable punishment to all our enemies. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 47th day of the Russian-Ukrainian war, this shameful invasion that is gradually wiping Russia out of international relations, is coming to an end. Invasion that makes it more and more toxic every day. Now it is only a matter of time before the Russian army with its own actions and war crimes forces everyone in the world to renounce all ties with the Russian Federation. Security work is underway in the northern regions of our country, from where the occupiers were expelled. First of all, it is mine clearance. Russian troops left behind tens if not hundreds of thousands of dangerous objects. These are shells that did not explode, mines, tripwire mines. At least several thousand such items are disposed of daily. The occupiers left mines everywhere. In the houses they seized. Just on the streets, in the fields. They mined people's property, mined cars, doors. They consciously did everything to make the return to these areas after deoccupation as dangerous as possible. Due to the actions of the Russian army, our territory is currently one of the most contaminated by mines in the world. And I believe this should also be considered as a war crime of Russian troops. They deliberately did everything to kill or maim as many of our people as possible, even when they were forced to withdraw from our land. Without the appropriate orders, they would not have done it. This afternoon I met on Bankova Street with an expert group working on the creation of a special mechanism for pre-trial investigation and judicial review of all war crimes committed by the occupiers. We are working on a legal way to bring the occupiers to justice, which will be as effective and as fast as possible. In order not to wait for decades until all international legal procedures are completed, but to accelerate the onset of justice. I expect that the options for creating such a special mechanism will be presented in the near future. Today, the occupiers issued a new statement, which testifies to their preparation for a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders. One of the mouthpieces of the occupiers stated that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible. I want to remind the world leaders that the possible use of chemical weapons by the Russian military has already been discussed. And already at that time it meant that it was necessary to react to the Russian aggression much tougher and faster. The European Union has now begun discussing a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. It is time to make this package such that even a word about weapons of mass destruction is no longer heard from the Russian side. An oil embargo against Russia is mandatory. Any new package of sanctions against Russia that does not affect oil will be received in Moscow with a smile. I spoke about the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia in my address to the parliament and people of the Republic of Korea. This week I will continue this format of communication with partner countries. Tomorrow I will address the parliament and the people of the Republic of Lithuania. By the way, Prime Minister of Lithuania Ingrida Šimonytė paid a visit to Ukraine today. I am grateful to her for the support, as well as to all the Lithuanian people. The issue of punishing all those guilty of crimes against Ukrainians was also discussed today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. The second important topic of our conversation was the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. We will continue to coordinate our steps to force the Russian Federation to seek peace. I also discussed cooperation in the energy sphere with the Prime Minister of Norway. Expressed gratitude for the support of efforts aimed to force Russia to seek peace. I also held talks with the Chairperson of the African Union, President of Senegal. Informed him about the current situation in Ukraine, about the global threats posed by the Russian invasion. The key task both today and every day at this time is concrete defensive measures. A concrete increase in our ability to repel any attacks by Russian troops. I am dealing with this issue almost around the clock. I'm sure people see it, too. Just as they see that the military and technical capabilities of the enemy are still very high. Yes, Ukrainians are incomparably braver. Our Armed Forces are beating the occupiers with wisdom and well-thought-out tactics inaccessible to the Russian military. But when it comes to the necessary weapons, we still depend on the supply, on our partners. Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner. To completely destroy the enemy on our land. And to fulfill those tasks that are obvious to each of our people. In particular, to unblock Mariupol. If we got jets and enough heavy armored vehicles, the necessary artillery, we would be able to do it. But... We still have to agree on this. We still have to persuade. We still have to squeeze out the necessary decisions. I am sure that we will get almost everything we need. But not only time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost. Lives that can no longer be returned. And this is also the responsibility of those who still keep the weapons Ukraine needs in their armory. The responsibility that will forever remain in history. Just as our gratitude will remain in history. Gratitude to those states and politicians who really helped. Who did not waste time. Who didn’t bargain when life depended on help. I also signed several important decrees. 187 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 15 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine and 6 servicemen of the Main Intelligence Directorate were awarded. The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to 5 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in particular to 2 colonels of the medical service: Ivchuk Viktor Mykhailovych - thanks to his actions more than a hundred lives were saved in Mariupol. Both of the military and civilians. Slesarenko Oleksandr Petrovych - thanks to his actions in the city of Chernihiv, medical care was provided to more than 450 servicemen and more than 600 civilians. I am grateful to all our heroes! Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear deputies of the National Assembly, Ladies and Gentlemen, Korean people! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you on behalf of the whole of Ukraine, which has been opposing the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation for 47 days already. Russia attacked us. Attacked, taking advantage of its military force. This state has spent decades preparing for this war. Decades and enormous resources. Financial resources - hundreds of billions of dollars received for the export of oil and gas and used for the production and accumulation of weapons. As well as human resources. Already about 2,000 missiles have been fired at our cities by Russia. Artillery shells are simply impossible to count. But the worst thing is how Russia uses people to prepare and wage war. For the people of Russia such conditions are deliberately created when they are forced to live in total, utter poverty. When they can't afford even the simplest things - normal food, ordinary household appliances, normal education. When they do not have even basic human rights guarantees throughout their lives. And when service in the army for many of them becomes the only, so to speak, social mobility option. Opportunity to get at least something in life. At least somehow try to fend for oneself. When they got to the war and entered the territory of a neighboring state, tens of thousands of Russian servicemen were simply shocked by the normality of life. They were shocked by cities and villages where people were not in need. Shocked by home appliances in houses. Shocked that people had normal food. A significant number of occupiers simply have never seen such a thing in their lives. Almost immediately, Russian troops started looting in the territory of Ukraine - in those areas that they managed to invade. They tried to take home to Russia everything of any value. From washing machines to computers. From auto parts to clothes. They just stuffed armored personnel carriers, trucks, stole cars and tried to take out the loot. You know, there were cases when Russian soldiers took protective plates from their bulletproof vests to hide stolen laptops and tablets in bulletproof vests. It is impossible to believe - when a person is so poor from birth that he thinks that a laptop is more valuable than his own life in the war. But this is exactly what we saw on our land when the Russian army invaded. It is a collision of two different worlds. The world of ordinary people who just lived a peaceful life, just wanted harmony for themselves and their children, thought about the future. And the world of people who have been specially humiliated by their state for decades, specially driven into poverty and lawlessness, so that their government can send them to any venture. To any war against neighbors. And this is Russia's war not just to conquer Ukraine. This is only the first step. First, Russia wants to destroy our independence, our state, to tear it apart. Wants to destroy everything that makes us Ukrainians, makes us a separate nation. And then it wants to go further to Europe. Further to Asia. In the occupied Ukrainian territory, the Russian military purposefully searched for teachers, any people related to the army and the functioning of the state, activists, journalists. All those who educated and defended the national idea. Such people were abducted. Such people were killed. Deliberately. It was an order, it was a tactic. But Russia has only just begun with Ukraine. The next step in their plan is to destroy other states. Attempt to conquer other neighboring nations. Russia wants to dominate. And it believes that it can do this in only one way: sending its army brought up in total lawlessness to destroy everything that allows other nations to live. With missile and air strikes at our territory, Russia has already destroyed hundreds of infrastructure facilities that ensured normal economic and social life in Ukraine. Russian missiles and aircraft are destroying oil depots, destroying food warehouses, airports, railway stations, manufacturing plants and universities. 938 educational facilities alone have been destroyed. Almost 300 hospitals. This is a deliberate tactic of the Russian troops, not something accidental. They are deliberately destroying residential neighborhoods and entire cities. Using artillery, mortars, tanks. Not one city, not two, not three. These are dozens of cities that the Russian military simply tried to wipe off the face of the earth. Black ruins instead of high-rises. Piles of stone and concrete debris instead of ordinary peaceful cities. We still cannot determine the number of deceased. From the north to the south of the country - in all areas where Russian shells reached, bombs reached - the dismantling of debris is still ongoing. Active hostilities are still going on in part of our territory. Russia is preparing another offensive. Hoping to break our national resistance after all. The occupiers concentrated tens of thousands of soldiers and a huge amount of equipment to try to strike again. The worst situation is in Mariupol, in our southern port city, which has been blocked by Russian troops since March 1. It was a city of half a million. Half a million people. The occupiers blocked it and did not even allow food and water to be brought there. They tried to capture it in the most brutal way - just to destroy everything in the city. Mariupol is destroyed. There are tens of thousands of dead. But even despite this, the Russians do not stop the offensive. They want to make Mariupol a demonstratively destroyed city. Ladies and Gentlemen, Korean people! This could be seen in the 20th century. And you remember that. You know what it's like to defend your land. You remember when in the 1950s you were attacked by those who wanted to destroy your freedom. They destroyed, they killed. What would they have left from your identity if they had succeeded? This is a horrible question. But you withstood, the world helped you. Now we want the same. There is no hope that Russia will simply stop on its own. There is no hope that reason will prevail, and the Russian leadership will simply refuse to continue this war. Russia can only be forced to do so. It can only be forced to seek peace. Forced to stop tormenting people. Forced to respect the independent life of neighboring nations. Forced to leave the territory of Ukraine. Our anti-war coalition, formed after the beginning of this brutal invasion of Russia, has already imposed unprecedented sanctions against it. But these sanctions are not enough. Russia does not yet feel that it must stop. This means that much more needs to be done. And not only at the state level. Russian banks' ties with the global financial system must be severed. It is necessary to limit Russia's exports of energy resources, especially oil. But it is also necessary that world companies stop being sponsors of this barbaric state, which believes that it has the right to destroy the lives of nations. Which believes that it has the right to sow poverty, lawlessness and death around the world. The more companies stop trading with Russia, work in Russia, pay taxes to the Russian state, the faster reason will win. Russia will have to give up militancy and seek compromises with the world. Because it has already come to the point that Russia is openly blackmailing the world with nuclear and chemical weapons! But working strategically, we need to protect people here and now. Protect those directly threatened by the Russian army. For 47 days we have been defending ourselves against virtually the entire Russian army - its most capable units. Our Armed Forces of Ukraine are fighting heroically, very wisely, rationally using available resources and weapons. We receive help from around the world. And I am sincerely grateful to your state, sincerely grateful to your people for their support. But we need much more. To survive in this war against such a prepared adversary as the Russian Federation. Against a state that does not count the dead and has countless stock of military equipment since the days of the Soviet Union… We need air defense systems, aircraft, tanks and other armored vehicles, artillery systems and ammunition. And you have something that can be indispensable for us. You have it. Armored vehicles, anti-aircraft, anti-tank, anti-ship weapons. When it comes to survival in a war aimed at the complete conquest of the people, it is necessary to give principled answers. The usual rules for the supply of weapons must be reviewed and action must be taken quickly. It is necessary to help. Providing the necessary weapons to Ukraine means not only saving the lives of our people, not only giving us the opportunity to unblock our cities, in particular our long-suffering Mariupol, but also saving other states and other regions from further deployment of Russian aggression. Every nation has the right to live independently. Every city has the right to complete security. Every person has the right to freedom and to seek personal happiness. People should not be instruments of some regimes, some dictators. People have the right to just live. That's what we're fighting for. That’s what we ask you to defend with us. And that is what we will rebuild - I hope together with you and the whole world - after this war. Ladies and Gentlemen! Korean people! Today in this address I mentioned our Mariupol four times. Our city, which is experiencing the darkest time in its history. Our city, which Russian troops are simply destroying. I would like you to watch one video now. Footage taken by a journalist who endured weeks of Russian blockade in Mariupol. I ask you to see with your own eyes what Ukrainians have been seeing for 47 days. We ask for help to stop this. For the cities of Ukraine and other states to never see such evil again. So that Russia can never come to them again. Please watch this video.

0,"Ukrainians! The bravest people of the best country in the world! Another week of our struggle for freedom, for the state, is coming to an end. Another week when Ukraine lives despite all Russia's efforts to destroy us. We defend ourselves. Hit back. We develop our relations with partners. We receive help. We ensure the maximum attention of the world to our needs. Influence the global debate. Propose and promote new sanctions against Russia. We are doing everything we can to bring to justice every bastard who came to our land under the Russian flag and killed our people. Who tortured our people. Destroyed our cities. Looted and tormented. And what is Russia doing? What are its officials, its propagandists and ordinary people doing who repeat what they have heard on television? They are only justifying themselves and denying. They are trying to shift the responsibility. They are lying. And they have already lost connection with reality to a degree that they accuse us of committing what Russian troops have obviously done - obviously for everyone in the world. They say about the murders in Bucha that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it is obvious to everyone that people were killed while the Russian army controlled the city. They say about the missile strike at Kramatorsk that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it was their propagandists who announced this strike. Although missiles flew from the territory under their control. And about any of our destroyed cities, about any of our burned villages, they say the same thing, that it is not them either, but allegedly us. The Russian militaries have already lied to the fact that even after more than six weeks of war, they claim that they did not hit any of the civilian objects! Do you know why this is so? Because it's cowardice. Total. Of everyone. Top to bottom. They are afraid to admit that Russia's entire policy toward Ukraine has been erroneous for decades and has only ruined everything Russia had in its relations with Ukraine since previous times. They are afraid to admit that for decades they have been placing erroneous bets and spending enormous resources in support of absolute nobodies who they thought would be the future heroes of Ukrainian-Russian friendship. And these nobodies were skillful at only one thing - taking money out of Russia into their own pockets. In order not to admit mistakes, they made new mistakes. They deprived themselves of any political tools and, unwilling to give up unrealistic ambitions, started this war. And, as in everything else, they accused us that the war had begun. They seized Crimea - and we are allegedly to blame. They destroyed normal life in Donbas - and we are allegedly to blame. They shot down a Malaysian Boeing - and we are allegedly to blame. They have been killing people and children on our land for eight years - and we are allegedly to blame. They destroyed the most powerful industrial region in Eastern Europe - and we are allegedly to blame. They ruined the lives of millions of people - and we are allegedly to blame. They started a full-scale war against us - and we are allegedly to blame. They have already spent almost two thousand missiles, countless air bombs and artillery shells, mines on strikes at Ukraine - and we are allegedly to blame. They tortured and killed on our land - and we are to blame. They deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, our children - and yet we are allegedly to blame. It all came from cowardice. When cowardice grows, it turns into a catastrophe. When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality, learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this. Nothing will help Russian cowardice. The day will come when they will have to admit everything. Admit the truth. All our strength and every minute are aimed at this. Defense, diplomacy, economics, information confrontation, legal responsibility - we have algorithms of action in all areas. Every government official knows his tasks and must fulfill them one hundred percent. Next week will be no less important than this one than the previous ones. It will be just as tense and even more responsible. Russia will be even more afraid. Afraid to lose. Afraid that the truth will have to be admitted. Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state. They can use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs. But we are preparing for their actions. We will respond. We will be even more active in providing Ukraine with weapons. We will be more active in the international arena. We will be even more active in the information field. I will continue to address the parliaments and nations of the world. We will meet our partners, leaders of other states in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. We will attract even more funds and resources to help Ukraine. Of course, we will justify stronger sanctions against the Russian Federation. So that there is responsibility, so that there is justice. No matter how afraid they are to admit their mistakes - tragic, terrible mistakes - they will have to. Because our courage and our truthfulness clearly prevail. And they will win. Today is the twelfth anniversary of the plane crash near Smolensk, which took the lives of President Lech Kaczyński and members of the Polish elite. On this day, we stand in solidarity with our Polish friends and allies who are firmly opposed to Russian aggression. I spoke today with Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. About how to bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes. How to strengthen sanctions against Russia and how to force Russia to seek peace. I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favor of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical. Because this course is supported by the majority of the German people. And I am grateful to them. But I expect that everything we agreed on will be implemented. And this is very important. And a few minutes ago, in preparation for the recording of this address, I signed a decree on state awards to our heroes. 18 defenders of Ukraine. Five servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, three employees of the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine, ten police officers. I am grateful to all our male defenders! To all our female defenders! I am grateful to all those who restore life in the liberated territory of our state. And I am grateful to all those who ensure our victory in the information confrontation. To all journalists, to editors, to the information marathon ""United News"", to all our websites, to all media representatives that do not allow Russian propaganda to win. The truth will win! Ukraine will win! Definitely. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Free people of a brave country! Today, it was a great honor for me to welcome in our capital, on Bankova Street, a sincere friend of Ukraine - Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson on your behalf, on behalf of all Ukrainians. His visit to our country demonstrates as clearly as possible - there are no obstacles to freedom. There are no obstacles to leadership. Boris was among those who did not hesitate for a moment whether to support Ukraine. The leadership of the United Kingdom in providing our country with the necessary assistance, especially in terms of defense, as well as the leadership in sanctions policy will remain forever in history. In the history of the defense of democracy, in the history of the defense of Europe. Ukraine will always be grateful to Boris and Britain for this. Today Boris arrived in Kyiv with a new package of financial and defense support for Ukraine. We also discussed new sanctions that are needed to force Russia to seek peace. The task of our anti-war coalition is quite clear - to end this war started by Russia as soon as possible. To liberate our land from invaders. And to guarantee the security of Ukraine and, consequently, the security of democracy and freedom of the nations of Eastern Europe. That is why it is not just the moral duty of all democracies, all the forces of Europe - to support Ukraine's desire for peace. This is, in fact, a strategy of defense for every civilized state. To put pressure on Russia as much as possible to restore peace and security as soon as possible. To restore the power of international law as soon as possible and to prevent the catastrophe caused by the application of the law of force. The catastrophe that will inevitably hit everyone. Because Russian aggression was not intended to be limited to Ukraine alone. To the destruction of our freedom and our lives alone. The whole European project is a target for Russia. I was pleased to hear today from Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer an assurance that for the Austrian state to force Russia to seek peace is as fundamental as for other responsible states. I also heard the promise that Austria, together with its partners in the European Union, will continue its sanctions policy against Russia until the full restoration of real security in our region takes place. Until Russia withdraws all its troops from the Ukrainian sovereign territory. In response to my question, the Austrian Chancellor also supported a clear prospect of Ukraine's accession to the European Union as soon as possible. That is, today was a really fruitful day for Ukraine. For our diplomacy. And this is the 45th day of our defense against the Russian invasion. Could Moscow think that such events would take place in Kyiv on the 45th day after their invasion? No, they couldn't even imagine it. And we made it a reality. All of us, together - every Ukrainian who on February 24 and forever chose courage. Chose Ukraine. Chose freedom and the future. In all international negotiations, in all contacts with world leaders during these 45 days, I always raise three topics. The first is concrete assistance for our defense. The second is concrete assistance for our people. The third is concrete guarantees of security for our state, which will definitely win in this confrontation. Of course, I do not hear specific answers to my specific questions from everyone. But there are more and more positive things for Ukraine every day. However, still not as much so that we can determine the exact date of the end of this war. Russia can still afford to live in illusions and bring new military forces and new equipment to our land. And it means that even more sanctions are needed. Even more weapons for our state are needed. By the way, Boris Johnson was very specific today in answering my questions. Well, as always. We have already decided what help the United Kingdom will provide to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. The British people are ready to take patronage over the restoration of Kyiv and the Kyiv region. The introduction of more painful restrictions on cash flows of the Russian Federation is among the priorities for our diplomacy, for all contacts with our partners. First of all this applies to the oil business. The democratic world can definitely give up Russian oil and make it toxic to all other states. Oil is one of the two sources of Russian self-confidence, their sense of impunity. Another source - gas - will also be shut down over time. It's just inevitable. Not only for safety, but also for environmental reasons. But Ukraine does not have time to wait. Freedom does not have time to wait. When tyranny launches aggression against everything that keeps peace in Europe, action must be taken immediately. It is necessary to act in a principled fashion. And the oil embargo should be the first step. At the level of all democracies, the whole civilized world. Then Russia will feel it. Then it will be an argument for them - to seek peace, to stop pointless violence. And another piece of news for today. Long-awaited for many of our people. One of our main shrines will return to Ukraine. One of the most revered shrines of Sophia of Kyiv. The icon of St. Mykola Mokryi (Wet), the first miraculous icon of Russia. We’ve been working for a long time to get it back. It was taken out of Ukraine during World War II. And in due time it will be at home - in St. Sophia. I am grateful to the hierarchs, clergy and faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States for this decision. I want the return of this shrine to be an important symbol for all of us. A fundamental symbol. A symbol that we will return all ours to Ukraine. Everything Ukrainian. We will bring all our people back. And we will definitely restore justice - restore our complete control over our land. I am grateful to all our friends! I am grateful to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! The 44th day of our defense against the Russian invasion is coming to an end. The 44th dark day. Russian troops launched a missile attack on the Kramatorsk railway station this morning. 38 people died on the spot. Another 12 people died in hospitals during the day. We lost five children. Dozens more heavily wounded remain in hospital. This is another war crime of Russia, for which everyone involved will be held accountable. Russian state propagandists were in such a hurry to shift responsibility for the attack to Ukrainian forces that they accidentally blamed Russia. RIA Novosti reported that the strike on Kramatorsk had been inflicted when the missiles were still in the air. The day before, other Russian propagandists were spreading threats to all those who escaped from Donbas by rail. All the world's leading powers have already condemned Russia's attack on Kramatorsk. We expect a firm, global response to this war crime. Like the massacre in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal, which is bound to happen. All the efforts of the world will be aimed to establish every minute: who did what, who gave orders. Where did the rocket come from, who was carrying it, who gave the order and how the strike was coordinated. Responsibility is inevitable. I spoke about this today with representatives of the European Union who arrived in Kyiv. With President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell. During the day, they visited Bucha and witnessed the consequences of the occupation. They saw how many people were killed by the Russian military. I appreciate the EU's readiness to provide the necessary financial and technical assistance to document and investigate Russian crimes. I am grateful to the President of the European Commission for her personal involvement and assistance in setting up a joint investigation team to establish the full truth about the actions of the Russian occupiers and bring all those responsible to justice. I am also grateful for the financial support - one billion euros for weapons. Plus today we agreed on another 500 million euros for defense needs. I held negotiations with the Prime Minister of Slovakia and thanked for the unprecedented defensive and other support. For the warmth of Slovak hearts towards Ukrainian men and women. We also talked with EU officials about further steps to force Russia to seek peace. I emphasized that the existing sanctions are not enough. The pressure on Russia must be increased. It is necessary to introduce a full energy embargo - on oil, on gas. It is energy exports that provide the lion's share of Russia's profits and allow the Russian leadership to believe in its impunity. This allows Russia to hope that the world will ignore the war crimes of its army. We will not allow this. Everyone in the world who has the courage, like Ukrainians, to resist tyranny will not allow this. Russian banks must also be completely disconnected from the global financial system. Not some of them, but all, the entire banking system of Russia. It is inadmissible that the greatest threat to global security is finding its way to global wealth. In this context, I also evaluate the new announced package of sanctions against Russia. I believe the softness with which some in the West still treat the Russian state is wrong. We know who is constantly trying to soften sanctions proposals. And we will do our best to finally make Europe understand: in any case, you will have to impose really principled and really strong sanctions against Russia. And not some partial restriction of Russian energy exports. Not some partial restriction of Russian navigation. We know everyone who delays the decisions. But I am confident that both these politicians and these countries will change their position under the pressure of all that Russia is doing against Ukrainians and against freedom in Europe. I addressed the Parliament and the people of Finland today. I called on Finnish politicians to do everything possible to help Ukraine. I also reminded that the best way to stop tyranny and protect freedom is to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons. The weapons we have repeatedly asked for from the West. The weapons that are available there. I will continue to fight every day, literally every hour, to get everything our state needs. Russia's war against our people may end in victory of freedom much sooner than many in the world think if Ukraine simply receives the weapons the list of which we have provided. Any delay in providing such weapons to Ukraine, any excuses can mean only one thing: the relevant politicians want to help the Russian leadership more than us Ukrainians. No matter what, we will continue to protect our land and our people in any case. Yes, not everyone in the world has found the courage we have. But we have powerful and principled partners and friends. Real friends who help Ukraine to really protect us. To really protect freedom in Europe. I am convinced that Ukraine's victory is only a matter of time. And I will do my best to reduce this time. By the way, we also talked today about the time needed for Ukraine's full accession to the European Union. Today we received a questionnaire from the European Commission. Finally. A questionnaire the answers to which will be the basis for preparing the conclusion of the European Commission on Ukraine's readiness for EU membership negotiations. Our Government will prepare answers qualitatively and very quickly. I think in a week. Next is the conclusion of the European Commission, which will be prepared in the next few months. And then there will be the decisions of the member states and the negotiations on accession. I am convinced of our success on this path. I am convinced that we are finally close to realizing our long-standing goal. Ukraine will be one of the equals in our common European home. Ukraine will be a member of the European Union. A peaceful, sovereign, rebuilt state. We will provide it. There is no doubt. We are also preparing for tomorrow's mass event in Warsaw, which will take place within the initiative of President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau – Stand for Ukraine. It is about the support for Ukrainians, for our migrants. All funds will be allocated for the support of Ukrainians. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Members of the Government! Dear Eduskunta deputies! Dear Chairman of the Swiss Federal Assembly! People of Finland! I'll start with what happened this morning. The Russian military struck at the railway station in our city of Kramatorsk. At the usual train station. At the ordinary people, there were no militaries. At the people who were waiting for trains to leave to a safe area. They hit people with missiles. There are witnesses, there are videos, there are remnants of missiles, but there are no more people. At least 30 dead. About 300 wounded. This is for now. Once again: this is an ordinary train station. An ordinary city in the east of our state. That's how Russia came to ""defend"" Donbas. That's how Russia came to ""protect"" Russian-speaking people. This is how we live for the 44th day. After 8 years of war in the east of our country. I ask you to honor the memory of all Ukrainian men and women killed by Russian soldiers, Russian missiles, Russian bombs with a moment of silence... Thank you. Russia has sent all its combat capable forces from all over their territory up to the Far East to seize Ukraine. But even they were not enough. That is why Russia is gathering as many people as possible who are capable of holding weapons in order to continue the aggression against Ukraine. Looking for mercenaries around the world. Sending militants from various de facto terrorist groups and so-called ""private armies"" created by some Russian officials. We have seen so many of them among the captured Russian military. Both very experienced killers and very young boys born in 2003-2004. But none of them could adequately explain why they need this war against Ukraine, what is the purpose of these missile strikes at civilians, what is the purpose of the cruelty that the world saw in Bucha and other cities liberated by the Ukrainian army. Of course, among the nearly two hundred thousand Russian occupiers on our land were those who did their best not to fight. Who fled to Russia, who deliberately surrendered, who inflicted severe injuries on themselves to get to the hospital and leave the war zone. But still it was a minority. And the majority of their army continues war on our land for no apparent reason. Absolutely pointless. And as cruel as possible. Continues to fight in a way that you often think - are they people at all? Yesterday, the Russian military fired from artillery at a boat with civilians on the Kakhovka reservoir. People were just trying to escape from the occupied territories. But they were hit by ""Grad"". Three children, eleven adults. On the boat. In the middle of the reservoir. Tens of meters from the shore. And they are being hit by artillery... Hundreds and hundreds of cars with gunshot traces remained on all roads of our country in the areas where Russian troops entered. Ordinary cars of ordinary people who just wanted to live. The Russian military knew for sure that those were ordinary civilians. They saw that there was no threat. But they fired. There are many examples of such cars with people who were simply crushed by armored vehicles. Literally - crushed by tanks. You all know what the Russian military has done in our city of Bucha. But they still make such Buchas every day - from Kramatorsk to Mariupol, from Kharkiv to Kherson. And I'm sure you realize that if the Russian army is ordered to invade your land, they will do the same to your country. I do not wish you this. They will do what happened in Bucha to your cities. To the cities of any country that the leadership of the Russian Federation decides is allegedly part of their empire, not the land of another nation. And even if Russian soldiers do not understand why they need it, they will still be at war. Because it is hatred and contempt for other people that are being brought up now in Russia at the state level. Ladies and Gentlemen! People of Finland! You have already seen in your history the cruelty and absurdity of the invasion of Russia. Let's be honest: the threat remains. Everything must be done to prevent this from happening again. Russia's war against Ukraine is now deciding not only the fate of our state. Not only the fate of our people. But the fate of all those who have a common border with Russia. Like you 83 years ago, Ukraine has the courage to defend itself against the enemy whose forces far outnumber them. There are just a lot of them, in quantitative terms. They have a lot of equipment and a lot of missiles. A lot of people who can be thrown into the war. And a lot of dollars and euros earned from oil trade that are then spent on propaganda of aggression. But just as your courage saved your country from Stalin's invasion, our courage resists this invasion. For 44 days already. But much remains to be done to win. Of course, unlike before World War II, the democratic world has now realized that the expansion of tyranny cannot be ignored. If the people are fighting for freedom, they must be supported. But, unfortunately, this understanding is more common among nations than among some very influential politicians. Among smaller states than among some leading states. We still have to convince the world's powerful states on a daily basis that sanctions against Russia that it will not be able to circumvent and that will definitely stop its military machine are necessary. We still have to ask for the necessary help, for the necessary weapons. And we are still told that we still have to wait for the aircraft, anti-missile systems, tanks, anti-ship weapons. We are told that we have to wait while we are losing hundreds of people every day from Russian strikes. When dozens of our cities are destroyed. We have to wait while more than ten million Ukrainians have become IDPs. And we have to wait. When more than three million of these ten left our country... We must do everything together so that they can return home. We must do everything to stop Russia, to stop the war! So that peace is restored in Ukraine, and the Russian occupiers leave our sovereign territory. This cannot be delayed, ladies and gentlemen. We are told that we have to wait... But I have a question: should both those who kill our people and those who make us wait be held jointly accountable for the deaths of Ukrainians? Those who make us wait for the most necessary. Wait for the opportunity to defend ourselves, our life, wait for the weapons. I am sincerely grateful to Finland for not delaying when this invasion by the Russian Federation began. For coming to our aid immediately. For the fact that you made a historic decision to provide Ukraine with defense support. For being principled in sanctions matters. For being one of the moral leaders of our anti-war coalition. But I ask you to show even greater leadership, both at the level of the European Union and in bilateral relations with European countries, to support our struggle for freedom. For our common freedom. When this war continues, when tyranny loses the war against Ukraine, it will be one of the greatest contributions to Europe's security in decades. Consequently, one of the greatest contributions to the security of your state. That is why we need the weapons that your EU partners have. That is why we need truly effective, powerful sanctions against Russia. Permanent. Such a sanction cocktail, which will be remembered as Molotov cocktails. Insist on it! I am grateful to the Finnish companies that have already stopped working in the Russian market. But economic ties with this country must be severed, and I urge you to put pressure on all your companies that continue to support the Russian military machine through their taxes and excise duties in Russia. All Russian banks must be immediately isolated from the global financial system. We cannot limit ourselves to a partial response to Russia's threat to Europe and the democratic world, because freedom will not survive if the channels of nourishing tyranny are left. And we need to think together about how to protect Europe from Russia's energy weapons. Every educated person knows that the time of fossil fuels has passed. Mankind can no longer rely on coal, on oil. We need to look for cleaner energy sources for everyone. And if Russia uses energy to finance aggression against other nations and the spread of hatred in the world, it should be an additional incentive. This should speed up the decision-making process. How much longer will Europe ignore the need to impose an embargo on oil supplies from Russia? This is a matter of security in all senses of the word - from environmental to military. And I urge you to ask this question out loud to everyone in the European Union. So that the necessary decision finally appears. The world knows the formats of how to do it. And if Europe does not want to physically cut off supplies now, if it is not ready, although it is inevitable, the first step must be to apply a scheme to limit the flow of money for oil into Russia. Let this money accumulate on special accounts without Russia's access to it. Let Russia first restore peace and be held accountable for war crimes, and only then take its dollars and euros from oil trade. Let it remember the spirit of Helsinki and restore the Helsinki Accords in full, and only then will it be possible to discuss the economy, if necessary. And when we say that we need to stop the war, it is clear to all cultures and it is clear in all languages. When I say this in Ukrainian, it seems to me that there are no people who do not understand this. The same goes for German, Arabic, Chinese or any other language. Peace is the same value for all. War is the same evil for all. Ladies and Gentlemen! People of Finland! I believe that common sense will still prevail. I am confident that together we will be able to defend freedom and defend Ukraine. That is why we need to think now about how to rebuild our state after this war. The world knows about the leadership of your country, your people in the field of education. You have really built an educational system that allows you to protect personal freedom, make a person educated and teach respect for other people, the environment and the world. Other countries should learn this, too! During the month and a half of the Russian invasion, 928 educational institutions in Ukraine have already been destroyed or damaged. These are kindergartens, these are schools, these are universities. I invite your state, your companies, your specialists to join the restoration of our educational sector and the modernization of education in Ukraine. We must do everything we can to ensure that, even after this brutal war against our nation, our people continue to cultivate goodness in their hearts and stay open to the world. I believe in that. Because hatred must lose. Freedom must win. First - in Ukraine, and then - wherever tyranny will try to raise its head. Thank you Finland! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! The 43rd day of full-scale war is over. Russia's war against Ukraine. A war that has revealed the whole truth about our country, about all other countries, about Russia and about the world in general. This war shows how much everyone did not want to notice in our country. In our people. How much the world believed in foreign propaganda and Russian myths about Ukraine, not in reality. We have always been like that... We have always been brave. The bravest in the world. I am sure of that. Because who else would do what Ukrainians do? Who else had so much courage to constantly fight against any manifestations of tyranny and defend freedom? In every election, in revolutions and in war. Who else had the courage to fight against all Russian forces on land, in the air and at sea? Who else had the courage to go unarmed against Russian armored vehicles where the Russians temporarily managed to seize something? Who else had the courage to tell the world that hypocrisy is a bad weapon? And not just to tell, but to convince and restore honesty in the world. Who else had the courage to persuade the largest global companies to forget about accounting and recall morality? And to teach all political leaders - whatever they are - to be at least a little Ukrainian... At least a little brave. In fact, this is our brand. This is what it means to be us. To be Ukrainians. To be brave. If everyone in the world had at least ten percent of the courage that we Ukrainians have, there would be no danger to international law at all. There would be no danger to the freedom of the nations. We will spread our courage. We will start a special global campaign. We will teach the world to be not just a little bit, but full of courage. Like us, like Ukrainians. There are certain results already. First of all, they are manifested in the current sanctions against the Russian Federation. But that's the thing - the results are still ""certain"". Not yet the ones needed to stop Russia. To stop the war. Please note: this is not the first day that the media has been talking not about how sanctions against Russia actually work, but about why these sanctions are important. As if they are convincing themselves that they have introduced the right things, that there are enough restrictions. But if the sanctions really worked one hundred percent, they would not have to explain in such detail why they are important. Therefore, I emphasize once again: more sanctions are needed. Even bolder sanctions are needed. Courage must be a criterion for evaluating decisions. Courage and practicality. First of all, Ukraine needs weapons that will allow us to win on the battlefield. And this will be the strongest sanction against Russia of all possible ones. We have good diplomatic news today. Russia is gradually losing even on those platforms that it considered quite comfortable for itself. In particular, the UN General Assembly decided to suspend Russia's membership in the Human Rights Council. It is quite logical. Quite rightly. But also not without fighting for this decision. I am grateful to those states that have supported this decision. Russia has had nothing to do with the concept of human rights for a long time already. Maybe someday that will change. But so far, the Russian state and the Russian military are the greatest threat on the planet to freedom, to human security, to the concept of human rights as such. After Bucha, this is already obvious. And the work on dismantling the debris in Borodyanka began... It's much worse there. Even more victims of the Russian occupiers. And what will happen when the world learns the whole truth about what the Russian military did in Mariupol? There, on almost every street, is what the world saw in Bucha and other towns in the Kyiv region after the withdrawal of Russian troops. The same cruelty. The same heinous crimes. More and more information is coming in that Russian propagandists are preparing, so to speak, a ""mirror response"" to the shock of all normal people from what they saw in Bucha. They are going to show the victims in Mariupol as if they were killed not by the Russian military, but by the Ukrainian defenders of the city. To do this, the occupiers collect corpses on the streets, take them out and can use them elsewhere in accordance with the elaborated propaganda scenarios. We are dealing with invaders who have nothing human left. To justify their own killings, they take the murdered people simply as scenery, as propaganda props. And this is a separate war crime, for which each of the propagandists will be held accountable. More and more countries around the world support the need for a full and transparent investigation of all war crimes of the Russian occupiers in Ukraine. Every murder case will be solved. Each of the torturers will be found. All those who committed rape or looting will be identified. Responsibility is inevitable. Today I continued to address the parliaments and nations of neighboring countries, our partners, our friends. Today was Greece. Today was the Republic of Cyprus. I thanked them for supporting Ukraine and joint European efforts to force Russia to seek peace. I urged to do more to stop the war. I urged Greece to use its influence as part of the European Union to save Mariupol. I urged Cyprus to take special measures against Russia. Such as the abolition of ""golden passports"" for Russians. As well as the blocking of yachts, the blocking of other Russian vessels in the waters of Cyprus. I am planning an address to the Parliament and the people of Finland tomorrow. I would like to note that diplomatic representatives of other states are returning to the capital together with Kyiv residents. The Turkish Embassy returned yesterday. The Ambassador of Lithuania returned today. Earlier, the Slovenian Embassy resumed its work in Kyiv. I am sincerely grateful to the friends of Ukraine who support us exactly as we need it now, also at the level of symbols, at the level of diplomatic gestures. This is also about courage. And I look forward to the opportunity to have a meeting with everyone who is with us. With all who are brave. Come back. With all the diplomats who have returned to our capital and continue to work. The presence of foreign diplomatic missions in Kyiv is a normal work of embassies, it is a clear signal to the aggressor that Kyiv is our capital. Not the provincial city of Russia, but the Ukrainian capital. The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to do everything to repel the offensive of Russian troops in Donbas. The occupiers’ troops in this area are becoming more active and are being reinforced from Russia. We see it all. We analyze every step of the enemy. And we will provide an answer. A tough one. And already a stable tradition: before delivering this address, I signed decrees to honor our bravest soldiers with state awards and the title of Hero of Ukraine. 344 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded. Five more servicemen became Heroes of Ukraine today. I am sincerely grateful for the service to each of our male defenders. I am sincerely grateful to each of our female defenders! I am sincerely grateful for the courage of the Ukrainian people. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies! Dear Cypriot people! I am grateful for the honor of addressing you in this format and at this time. At a crucial time for my country and for the survival of the Ukrainian people. For freedom in Europe. It is now being decided whether we will preserve the unity of our territory and our state. Whether we will guarantee freedom for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe. For different countries where Russian troops can go after Ukraine. Every day and night we think of only one thing - how to save as many people as possible. How to help everyone we can to survive Russia's brutal invasion. An invasion that has already killed thousands of Ukrainians. Shot, tortured, killed by missiles, air bombs, tanks. The Russian military does not spare anyone - neither women nor children. Ukrainians have not seen such atrocities since the Nazi invasion during World War II. And I ask you... Please, just look. Look at what we have been going through for 43 days already. Please watch a short video. *** God forbid any other nation will have to go through this… Experience how Russian soldiers killed people on the roads in Bucha for fun. How in Irpin, they raped underage girls and then strangled them as experienced killers. How in Mariupol, a little girl was forced with gunshots to run down the street. Because it is permissible for them to hunt people, it is fun for them. How in Kharkiv, dozens of ordinary civilians were killed in a minute by the artillery shelling of residential high-rises. When you see so many deaths every day... When killed people are buried in mass graves in your cities, just in the yards, because it is impossible to take bodies to cemeteries... You hope and seek, and believe that you will be able to save at least those whom you especially sympathize with. At least those who certainly cannot be involved in any disputes of the adult world, in any conflicts. Since March 10, Ukrainians have hoped to find a little boy alive, little Sashko. A four-year-old boy who disappeared when adults escaped from the occupiers on a boat across the Dnieper. There was no other way to escape then - the Russian military blocked all roads. They shot people on the roads. So the adults tried to escape from them by the river. But the boat capsized. According to witnesses, after the shelling... Sashko was the only one in the life jacket, so we hoped until the end. We hoped to find him alive. Sashko’s grandma died. And later we found his body. He became one of 167 children who died during the full-scale Russian invasion of our state. And these are only those about whom we know for sure. There may be many more children killed in the occupied areas, in the cities around which hostilities are taking place. Children whose lives were taken by this war, Russia's war against Ukraine. Why does Russia wage this war? What is the goal of Russian troops? The answer to these questions is quite clear. We have heard it many times from politicians in the Russian Federation and from Russian state propagandists. We also know this answer from those documents that were seized along with Russian prisoners of war and found in the destroyed headquarters of Russian troops. They wanted to destroy our statehood and tear our country apart. Divide Ukraine into parts. They wanted to take as much as they could. And all that they could not capture, they wanted to weaken as much as possible, to destroy as much as possible. Russia sought to create a new split in Europe that would meet the inadequate ambitions of the current generation of Russian leaders. They simply do not take most countries in the world seriously. They do not respect most nations. They consider everyone in the world either as those they want to use, or as those they want to conquer, or as those they want to intimidate. They consider Ukraine among those in the second group. That is why Russia came to us with the war. But all other states should think into which group they were included and what really underpins Russia's policy toward them. I am sure that no country in the world will find two things among the answers to this question - true respect and not feigned equality. That is why the democratic world has united in its negative attitude towards Russia. Ukraine was attacked by Russia a long time ago - in 2014. When Russia tried to divide our state by force for the first time. When our Crimean peninsula was occupied. When Russia started the war in Donbas. But then the world's response was weak, very weak. Many in the world still believed that constructive relations could be at the heart of relations with Russia. That the dialogue with Russia can be sincere and based on the principle of mutual respect. Years have taught the world that this was all a mistake. And the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 this year showed that the Russian leadership perceived the good attitude of other states simply as a weakness. Can such behavior go unpunished? Is it right that the Russian state and its citizens are trying to use your island to their advantage? While trying to destroy the whole nation. While trying to destroy another state. Ladies and Gentlemen! Cypriot people! I am grateful to you for the principled position with which you, together with the whole of the European Union, responded to Russia's full-scale invasion. You have adopted a powerful decision not to allow Russian warships to enter your ports. This really strengthens security throughout our region of great Europe. I am also grateful to you for your financial and humanitarian assistance. For an important resolution passed by your parliament in support of Ukraine. But Ukrainian children are still dying from Russian weapons. All our citizens still live in hell because of what the Russian occupiers have done on Ukrainian land. Russia is still preparing plans for a new offensive against our troops, against our cities... The Russian leadership still does not want to seriously seek peace with Ukraine. In response to all our negotiating proposals, which could have been accepted long ago in the interests of peace, in the interests of all in Europe, we hear only a play on words. This means that much more needs to be done, both at the EU and national level, to end this war. To force Russia to seek peace. Peace is an unconditional value for each of us. Therefore, I believe that together with you we will be able to provide the necessary pressure on the Russian leadership. The Republic of Cyprus has extremely powerful tools to influence Russian society. A unique force that can be put at the service of peace. All ports in the democratic world must be completely closed to Russian ships. This must be a joint decision - at the level of the European Union. But at the level of your state, it is also possible to at least freeze the use by Russians of all their yachts and other vessels in your waters. You can suspend the current privileges for Russian citizens. Starting from the so-called golden passports for all Russians without exception and ending with dual citizenship for them. Probably if it is verified and clearly proven that some of them condemn the war crimes of their military and do not intend to use your jurisdiction to avoid sanctions and other restrictions against Russia, only then will it be permissible to treat these people in the old way. Any efforts by Russian citizens subject to sanctions to circumvent these restrictions must be stopped. All the proper work needs to be done to prepare the European Union for the imminent embargo on energy supplies from Russia. I do not know how many more war crimes of the Russian military must be revealed, as it was in our city of Bucha, before all EU states have enough courage for the embargo. But Russia itself has chosen this path. It destroys innocent people in Ukraine. The democratic world must stop being a sponsor of Russia's war crimes. Of the destruction of cities, killing of children. And the democratic world must learn to guarantee real security for every state that can fall victim to aggression. When Ukraine says that we deserve full membership in the European Union, we mean, first of all, that we can bring to our common European home exactly the experience that can make each EU state stronger. It is an experience that can give Europe more justice. I'm sure you feel our pain. And that is why I believe that you will continue to support Ukraine, including on the road to the European Union. On the way to our common peace. Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear members of the Greek Parliament! Greek people! Kalimera! For more than a month now, my every morning begins with Mariupol. With what is happening in this Ukrainian city, which Russian troops are simply destroying. This has never happened in the history of Europe in all the years after World War II that a city is destroyed to ashes, destroyed completely. That it is under blockade and its inhabitants are killed with starvation and thirst. It was a city of half a million people! About a hundred thousand people still remain in it. But there are virtually no undamaged buildings, the vast majority of buildings in the city are completely destroyed. The Russian military destroyed everything. They blew up hospitals, maternity hospitals and apartment buildings. They even blew up the city theater where civilians were hiding from bombs and next to which were inscriptions that everyone saw - the inscriptions ""children"". The inscriptions seen by Russian pilots, which did not stop them from air strikes. Mariupol is almost destroyed. I'm sure each of you has already seen what the city looks like now. After it was approached by the Russian Federation. Just ruins. This is what Russia has done with our peaceful Mariupol. But also with your peaceful Mariupol. This city has always been home to a large Greek community. The Ukrainian Greek community is one of the largest in the world. For centuries, our people have lived side by side, raised children and built the future. The ties between Ukraine and Greece are so old that it is now impossible to find their origin. Greek poleis on our Black Sea coast, cultural exchange and trade, community coexistence - all this is thousands of years of history. Greek Chersonesus was even depicted on our national currency - hryvnia. It is with Greece that the development of Christianity is tied not only in our country, but also in our region in general. Ukraine is one of the largest Orthodox countries, and the light of Baptism was brought by the Greeks. If someone tried to snatch Greek roots from Ukrainian history and culture we would lose a fundamental part of ourselves. In the same way the basic things of your history, your national self-perception are tied with the Ukrainian land. ""Freedom or death!"" - these words now reflect not only our struggle against Russia's attempt to conquer Ukraine. This is a part of your identity that comes from our Odesa. Another southern city of Ukraine that Russia may try to destroy, as well as Mariupol. When your foreign minister was in Odesa last week, the city was experiencing the consequences of Russian shelling, another missile attack. There are no gunshots in Odesa today. But why? Only because the Armed Forces of Ukraine are deterring Russian attacks and repelling barbaric Russian troops from their direction of attack on Odesa long-agreed by Russian leadership. Russian troops have now brought death and destruction to where Ukrainians and Greeks have enjoyed peace and prosperity for centuries. Moreover, Russia has begun a new deportation of people from the south of Ukraine. At least tens of thousands of our people have already been deported to Russia and to the territories of Ukraine temporarily occupied by Russia. These are residents of Mariupol and other cities and communities that came under attack by Russian troops. This forced relocation of people by Russia is not the first one for both Greeks and Ukrainians. But the Russian state is carrying it out now as if deportation is not the last one. Russia is absolutely convinced of its impunity for everything it does. We have to stop it! We must bring Russia to justice. We must save Odesa from the same destruction that Mariupol suffered. We must find everyone, all the people deported by Russia. We must save at least those in Mariupol who are still alive and who can be saved! Ladies and Gentlemen! Greek people! Filiki Eteria, founded in our Odesa, has played a role in the history of your country, which cannot be overestimated. And I urge you now, openly, to create such a new union of friends, which will be able to save the Ukrainians and Greeks of the south of our state. Which will be able to help Mariupol. The city needs humanitarian aid! The city needs its people - survivors and wounded - to be saved. Russia has been blocking Mariupol since the beginning of March, blocking on land and at sea. It does not allow even basic humanitarian cargo into the city. I am convinced that the strength of Greece can help carry out this mission. Days are numbered. And now I ask you to listen not only to me. Regarding the fate of this city. Please listen to the two defenders of Mariupol who are now there, right there, and together with their colleagues are trying to stop the Russian offensive. Listen to two Ukrainians, but also two Greeks as well. One of them is forced to wear a mask, not to show his face. Because his family, his parents are in one of the Russian-occupied towns. I hope you understand. *** I am grateful to Greece for the humanitarian and defense support already provided to Ukraine. I am grateful for the support of the general sanctions policy of the democratic world. But the war continues. The destruction of Mariupol continues. You have heard these heroes. The deportation of people from the territories where Russian troops came continues. I urge you to use the influence of your state and your opportunities, as a member of the European Union, to organize the rescue of Mariupol. I urge you to do more to make Russia seek peace and even give up its dreams of conquering Ukraine. Because this war that Russia has started against us is actually destroying everything that Ukrainians and Greeks have created together in a long time. What will be left after the Russian artillery and Russian bombs? I will tell you: they will destroy all our common history, our common heritage. And we will not be comforted saying about Mariupol in the future: ""These are new Thermopylae"". When the heroes died, stopping a large enemy army. Now we can save our heroes. And we can also drive the enemy Russian army out of Ukrainian land. We can teach Russia and any other potential aggressors once and for all that whoever chooses war always loses. He who tries to deprive of independence and destroy the territorial integrity of states always loses. Anyone who blackmails Europe with an economic or energy crisis always loses. Let's be honest, Russia's actions from the beginning were aimed not only at Ukraine, but at Europe as a whole. Russia is doing everything to keep Europeans without available energy. And to make energy poverty a new reality on the continent. Russia is doing everything to provoke an outbreak of inflation for many nations. Russia last year artificially created a deficit in the European gas market. And now it is doing everything to artificially create a deficit in the world food market. It is a matter of honor for Europeans to respond to such a policy of the Russian Federation. As long as Russian troops block peaceful cities and deport people, no Russian bank has the right to make money from the world's financial system. They all must be blocked! All, not just part. As long as this pointless and brutal war continues, no Russian vessel has the right to enter the ports of the democratic world. Why help them? For them to earn even more money for missiles and bombs to destroy not only Mariupol, but also Odesa and other Ukrainian cities? And first of all - no support for Russian tankers, these oil carriers, which provide Russia with a constant flow of money for the killings. Ukraine needs weapons to force Russian troops to leave our country. In particular, air defense systems, artillery systems and shells, armored vehicles and other things that everyone in the West is well aware of. The sooner Ukraine receives this assistance, the more lives we will be able to save in Ukraine. And one more thing. Historical. Our nations have always been and will always be closely bonded. I believe that we will be able to bring peace to our Ukrainian land. We will be able to bring to justice all those responsible for these war crimes against Ukrainians, against Greeks and against all other people who fell victim to the Russian military. We will be able to rebuild Mariupol and all other Ukrainian communities where Ukrainians and Greeks will live just as peacefully and with respect for each other as it was before. But I also believe that Ukraine and Greece will soon live on an equal footing in our common European home, the European Union. I believe in this! I know it! We will win everyone! But only together! Thank you for your support! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! It seems that the attitude to the modern Russian state is finally changing in the world. After what the world saw in Bucha when Russian troops retreated. Now the attitude to everyone in Russia will be simple: you support either the search for peace or unjustified massacre. Killed Ukrainian men and women in Bucha, in Irpin, in other cities that Russian troops entered is the last argument. The last argument for every citizen of Russia to decide whether you are for war or for peace. If for war, then you will forever - until the end of your life - be outcasts and in the end you will lose everything. And if for peace, if you feel even a little bit of shame for what the Russian troops are doing in Ukraine, then now is a key moment for such citizens of Russia: you have to demand - exactly demand - an end to the war. It is better now, demanding peace, to lose something, to somehow face the Russian repressive machine than to be equated with the Nazis for the rest of your life. This applies not only to any public person in the Russian Federation, not only to businessmen, but also to ordinary citizens. Nazism has no future. Mass killings have no future. Everyone in Russia who will not demand an end to this shameful war and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine has no future. It seems that the Russian leadership is really afraid that the anger of the world because of what they saw in Bucha would be repeated because of what they will see in other cities, from where we will definitely drive out the occupiers. We have information that the Russian troops have changed their tactics and are trying to remove the killed people from the streets and basements of the occupied territory. Killed Ukrainians. This is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more. But they will not succeed, because they killed a lot. Responsibility cannot be avoided. We already know about thousands of missing people. We already know about thousands of people who could be either deported to Russia or killed. There are no other options for their fate. The situation now is that thanks to an objective investigation, thanks to witnesses, thanks to satellite surveillance of events on earth, thanks to other tools that help establish the truth we will find out all the circumstances regarding the majority of our missing citizens. Regarding most of Russia's war crimes in Ukraine. If the world has started a debate about whether it is permissible to call what the Russian military did on the territory of Ukraine genocide, the search for truth can no longer be stopped. You can't roll it back in any way. One can only quickly abandon further aggression against Ukraine and thus try to somehow reduce the damage to Russian statehood and to those who personally adopt key decisions in Russia. If not, if nothing changes, then it is suicide. Suicide for anyone who chooses to continue the war. Today, Western countries announced a new package of sanctions against the Russian Federation. New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough. Still it can hardly be called commensurate with the evil that the world saw in Bucha. With the evil that continues in Mariupol, in the shelling of Kharkiv, in Russia's attempt to launch a new global bloody offensive in Donbas... We will continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance. We will also continue to insist on one or another format of the democratic world's refusal to buy Russian oil. It is the export of oil that is one of the foundations of Russia's aggression. One of the foundations that allows the Russian leadership not to take seriously the negotiations on ending the war and on the liberation of Ukrainian territory. Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardize their own economies. But that's why people go into politics. To solve such problems, difficult tasks. To solve them quickly and in a principled fashion. If you are not capable, then you shouldn’t have started political activity. The embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere. It is good that the United States Department of the Treasury has suspended Russia's ability to use US bank accounts and related assets to pay its debt. It's tangible. And I'm grateful for that. But much more needs to be done to stop the war. If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas. It is still possible to prevent this. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The West can do it. Just as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole Western world. I addressed the parliament and the people of Ireland today. This country was one of the first to come to our aid after February 24. And it is one of those who shows principled leadership in the European house to put effective and decisive pressure on Russia. As a result of my address, we have good news: Ireland fully supports Ukraine's accelerated accession to the European Union. And it will do everything to increase the pressure on Russia as much as necessary to end this war. Tomorrow I will address the parliaments and nations of Greece and the Republic of Cyprus. In the afternoon I held a meeting with members of the Cabinet of Ministers in Kyiv. The key issues are the implementation of the state budget and economic activity in our country. We must do everything possible to restore the work of domestic enterprises, trade activities, and revive small and medium-sized enterprises throughout our territory where it is safe and possible to work. The economy is also a frontline on which we fight for our freedom, for our state, for our people. Therefore, we need to constantly look for ways to adapt to the circumstances. Now we need to be as creative and bold as possible in solving economic issues. It depends not only on government officials and the central government in general. In general, it also depends on all leaders at the local level, on the political and business communities. We must all find the necessary ideas, the necessary solutions to stabilize the country's economy together. If we need to relocate businesses from certain areas, we have to do it. If we need to update legislation and give businesses more room for development, MPs must do so quickly. If we need to create special conditions for the return of people, and the security situation in a particular area allows, every leader at any level must make every effort and do everything possible to return people to such safe areas. Today, the 42nd day of the Russian invasion has come to an end. This is not too much for military history. But for the life of a particular person - it is tangible. Right now, many of our people who left their cities, their communities after the invasion of Russia may wonder: what next? And where next? In particular, Ukrainians abroad. In particular, Kyivans and residents of other cities in the north and center of our state who moved to the western regions. And I call on all community leaders in areas where there is no threat of direct confrontation with the enemy on the ground to do everything possible for people to return, for people to work, for economic processes to restart. To restore normal life as much as security allows. This applies to the entire horizontal of local government - mayors, deputies of city and regional councils. Look for solutions for every district, for every region! Together with the government, together with us, with the Office of the President, together with the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada. A working economy is just as important as our brave, strong army. The Russian occupiers continue to accumulate fighting force to realize their ill ambitions in Donbas. They are preparing to resume an active offensive. We are preparing for a further reduction of Russia's military potential. Manpower and equipment. We will fight and we will not retreat. We will look for all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we will not give them up. I never tire of thanking each of our defenders everyday - all our Armed Forces, intelligence, special services, the National Police, everyone who allows us to hope and believe in victory. Allows us to count on peace. Sincere gratitude! Sincere respect! And before delivering this evening's address, I traditionally signed decrees on awarding our heroes. 168 servicemen of the Armed Forces. And 3 servicemen from the Main Directorate of Intelligence. Eternal glory to everyone who defends Ukraine! Eternal memory to everyone who gave life for our state! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear speakers! The Taoiseach and members of the government! Dear members of the Oireachtas! Dear people of Ireland! Tonight Russian missiles again struck the territory of our state. Foully hitting the ordinary civilian infrastructure. In particular, the new depot with fuel. One of the dozens that Russia sees as a target. And this has already become the trademark of the occupiers – to destroy everything that helps to arrange ordinary life of ordinary people. They consistently destroy fuel storage sites, product distribution centers, destroy even conventional agricultural machinery, and mine fields. They are constantly sowing mines everywhere. In every place they are leaving. In addition, Russia has blocked all our seaports, along with those vessels that have already been loaded with agricultural goods for export. Why are they doing this? Because they also consider hunger as their weapon. Weapon against us, ordinary people. As a tool to dominate. Ukraine is one of the leading countries in the global food market. Without our exports, it is not simply a shortage, but a threat of famine for more than a dozen countries in Africa and Asia. Because there will be not enough volumes of commodities and prices will hike. It's a fact. It will be harder for millions of the poor in North Africa and parts of Asia to feed their families. Now, it is the time of the planting season in Ukraine. To foil our planting season, to destroy our infrastructure is to deliberately provoke a food crisis. And what will happen due to this crisis? At least, it will be political turbulence. At most, there will be outbreaks of violence in regions where instability is becoming traditional, and a new mass influx of refugees who are simply looking for ways to survive will be seen. Russia has been using hunger against our people since the first days of the war. The worst is in Mariupol. This half-million city was completely blocked by Russian troops more than a month ago. They blocked access from both land and sea. Any access. They are blocking humanitarian goods, do not allow to bring anything – food, water, medicine. When there was snow, people could melt at least the snow to get water, but now there is none. Round-the-clock shelling, air raids, bombing continue... There is not a single building left in Mariupol, not a single undamaged building. In the city with the population of half a million – none. The dead and killed were buried in the yards of destroyed high-rise buildings. When they were able to do it. But in many cases it was not possible to bury. The bodies of people remained in the streets, in the ruins of houses, in collapsed basements. We do not know how many Mariupol residents have been killed by Russia. But we know for sure that this was part of the general tactics of the occupiers. They did the same or tried to do the same with Chernihiv, Sumy, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Izium, Volnovakha and many other Ukrainian cities. You may not have heard all these names yet. But these are millions of people that Russia was simply trying to destroy. And continues to do so. When you hear this, it may seem impossible. It may seem that no one in today's world would dare to do so. But these are real facts. The fact that the residents of Mariupol drew on the sheets of school notebooks how to find where the bodies of their loved ones are buried in the city yards. The fact that the Russian occupiers shot people on the roads as they tried to escape from the blocked cities. Hundreds of cars hit by shelling are still left on Ukrainian highways. The fact that the Russian military did not even try to remove the bodies of killed people from the streets. While Bucha, Irpin and other our cities were under occupation, the corpses were laying just on the roads, on the roadsides, in the yards of houses – anywhere... The fact that at least 167 children have been killed in 42 days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We do not yet know all the victims of Mariupol. We do not know the victims of other cities, areas where hostilities or occupation continue. The fact that 927 educational institutions and 285 hospitals have been destroyed or damaged in the shelling by Russia. Even 73 ambulances have come under the occupiers' fire! They bombed and shelled even churches... Even shelters, which they knew for sure that there was no one there but women and children... And that's a fact. A state that does this does not deserve to be among others in the international community. Russia does not deserve relations with it as with one of the normal states. It must be responsible for everything it has done on Ukrainian land. The Russian military came to Ukraine as an army of colonizers. Their state propagandists, their politicians don't even hide what they want anymore. In the 21st century, they see their state as a colonial empire that allegedly has the right to subjugate neighboring nations and destroy any basis for their independent living. Destroy even the very identity of nations. Everything that makes us Ukrainians... The Russian military purposefully searched for and killed teachers in the occupied territories. Everyone who was associated with the army. They kidnap local government officials and kill community leaders. Along with the Russian army, units to suppress any political resistance immediately they entered our territory were created... Now, when there are discussions about sanctions against the Russian Federation, I just can't hear any doubts, I can't see any indecision... After everything we have experienced in Ukraine. After all that the Russian troops did. Even now, when the world already knows everything about Russia's war crimes against our people, we have to persuade even some European companies to leave the Russian market. We still have to convince Western politicians in some countries that we need to stop any connection between Russian banks and the global financial system. Unfortunately, we still have to convince Europe that it is impossible that Russian oil provides the Russian military machine with a generous flow of money. Ladies and Gentlemen! Irish people! From the first days of the Russian invasion, you are on the side of good. On the side of freedom. On the side of Ukraine. And this is also a fact. You have no doubt whether to help us. You started doing it right away. And although you are a neutral country, you have not remained neutral to the grief and suffering that Russia has brought to Ukrainians. I am grateful to all of you for that. I am grateful to the leadership of your country, to every Irish man and woman. I am grateful for the support of sanctions against Russia. I am grateful for the humanitarian and financial support provided to us. Thank you for taking special care of our people who have sought and found safety in your land. Just think about it: Russia has already left homeless 10 million Ukrainians who were forced to flee their hometowns because of this war ... It is simply impossible to accept! But let us be aware that Russia has not yet given up on its plans. It is still continuing offensive operations in Ukraine. It is still looking for ways to conquer all our Ukrainian people. We must do everything together so that Russia forced to seek only peace. It seek only way to leave the territory of Ukraine and give us in peace. That is why I urge you to show even more leadership in our anti-war coalition! I urge you to persuade your EU partners to toughen sanctions against the Russian Federation. The sanctions that will really stop Russia's military machine. We need to stop all trade with Russia. Russia's banks' ties with the world's financial system must be blocked. We need to cut off the flow of money that the Russian budget receives for oil and spends it on missiles, bombs, artillery shelling... The world has long developed appropriate mechanisms. Everyone knows what to do. The only obstacle is the lack of principled stance of individual leaders. Yet. Political leaders, business leaders. Those who still think that war and war crimes are not as terrible as financial losses. I'm sure your leadership can change that. I am confident that all of us in Europe together will be able to end this terrible war and restore peace and stability in Eastern Europe. It is simply impossible to procrastinate with this. The longer the Russian aggression lasts, the worse the consequences will be not only for our continent, but also for the neighboring regions of our planet. Ladies and Gentlemen! Irish people! Our common principles, our common fearlessness have already started a new page in the history of relations between Ukraine and Ireland. Our mutual understanding and respect is at the level where we can say: it is only a matter of time before you and we live together in our common European home. I am grateful to you for supporting the special fast-track procedure for granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. With your leadership, it will be even faster and more profitable for both our nations. And now we need to think about the restoration of our country. About recovery after the war. We invite the leading countries of the planet to take part in the reconstruction of Ukraine. Of course, I invite Ireland to take part in this project. I do it with pleasure. For example, in our Kherson region. Your ability to value life and people, your ability to live in communities, your economic potential – they are well-known.

0,"Ukrainians! Today I will not take away much of your attention. The day was very informative. I will only briefly walk through the main points of my work this Tuesday, the 41st day of the invasion of the Russian Federation. I continued my active diplomatic work. Addressed the UN Security Council, which convened for a special meeting on Russia's war crimes in Bucha and in the occupied territories of Ukraine in general. I said what should have been said in this format a long time ago. The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn’t. For anyone. This definitely means that the United Nations is currently unable to carry out the functions for which it was created. And only one state is to blame for this - Russia, which discredits the UN and all other international institutions where it still participates. Well, not exactly participates... Tries to block everything constructive and use global architecture in order to spread lies and justify the evil it does. I'm sure the world sees it. I hope the world will draw conclusions. Otherwise there will be only one institution left in the world to guarantee the security of states. Namely - weapons. I offered to the members of the UN Security Council and to all other states that respect international law specific things that could change the situation. In particular, a global conference already in peaceful Kyiv to determine how the world's architecture can be reformed given all the actions of Russia, which is still occupying the seat of a permanent member of the UN Security Council received from the Soviet Union. I also addressed the Parliament and the people of Spain. A state that supports our struggle for freedom and for the preservation of democracy in Europe. I also spoke today with President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron about the humanitarian situation in the temporarily occupied regions of Ukraine. About how we can help people in the blocked Mariupol. We also agreed that France would provide the necessary technical and expert support in the investigation of the crimes of the Russian occupiers in Bucha and other cities of our country. We are preparing a new package of powerful sanctions against Russia for everything it has done to our people. Now is a crucial moment, especially for Western leaders. And this is no longer about how our people will evaluate the new sanctions and what I will say about them. This is about how decisions on sanctions will be assessed in Western societies themselves. After what the world saw in Bucha, sanctions against Russia must be commensurate with the gravity of the occupiers' war crimes. If after that Russian banks will still be able to function as usual... If after that the transit of goods to Russia will continue as usual... If after that the EU countries will pay for Russian energy resources as usual... Then the political fate of some leaders will develop not as usual. My advice to everyone: feel now that the moment is really crucial. We are preparing to welcome President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and head of European diplomacy Josep Borrell in Kyiv in the near future. Working together in Kyiv is something that will be praised by many nations of the world. And not only in Europe. Because now Kyiv is the capital of global democracy, the capital of the struggle for freedom for all on the European continent. And I want to thank all our defenders for making this possible. For the fact that the Armed Forces of Ukraine hold most of the areas where the enemy tried to break into the country. The most difficult situation, as in previous days, is in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. But we continue to do everything to ensure that our defenders have something to stop the Russian troops with. We are aware that the occupiers outnumber us. That they have more equipment. We are aware of the attempts by Russian leaders to recruit new fools all over Russia among cadets of military schools, people with combat experience and conscripts to send them all to slaughter in another offensive. But we have no other choice - the fate of our land and our people is being decided. We know what we are fighting for. And we do everything to win. Today in the Mariyinsky Palace I presented the Golden Star Orders to the servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine, and to the members of families of those who were posthumously awarded this title. Now it is in the Mariyinsky Palace, in the White Hall, where we always meet foreign heads of state, that such important ceremonies will take place. We will demonstrate every time that our defenders deserve respect and honor at the highest level. And the White Hall of the Mariyinsky Palace will henceforth be called the White Hall of the Heroes of Ukraine. I also handed over the Order of Courage to the family of the deceased documentary photographer Maks Levin who was viciously killed by the occupiers in the Kyiv region. During his life, he made a significant contribution to making us all see and know what is happening in our country. Traditionally, before delivering the evening address, I signed decrees awarding our military. 292 servicemen, 57 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to each of our defenders! Everything for the victory. Everything for peace. Everything for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies and senators! Dear members of the Government! Dear people of Spain! Thank you for this opportunity, with great respect from all the Ukrainian people to you. I am addressing you with the hope that you will understand most of all our pain from the war and our hope for peace. Because for us in Ukraine now absolutely everything that is the basis of public life for you is under threat. We are one of the largest countries in Europe. And one of the most variegated. But united by democracy and respect for every person, for every community. I want to give you just one example of our state, of our lives. We have the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations. Different denominations, different views on public life and relations between the state and the Church are always agreed peacefully and with respect for others in the format of this Council. This is just one example, but it shows that we, Ukrainians, are committed to peace and a conflict-free environment even in such sensitive issues that in many other societies always cause controversy and conflict. Russia came to our land with the war not yesterday and not the day before yesterday. It's been a long time. We have been protecting our country from brutal, unprovoked aggression since 2014. First - the occupation of our Crimea. Then - the war in the Ukrainian Donbas. Now - already 41 days of full-scale invasion. The worst war in Europe since World War II. But why did Russia come to us, to our home, to Ukraine? What exactly must Russian weapons destroy? Not just our people. Not just any basis for a peaceful life. But also the opportunity to live without a dictatorship. Opportunity to live without state violence. Opportunity to be a sustainable open democracy. Opportunity of peaceful coexistence of different religions, different communities. The format of Russian state life does not provide for everything that is absolutely familiar to us, to Ukraine. Russia wants to make sure that only one order dominates in our entire region - tyrannical. So that any diversity is destroyed. So that it is impossible to find common ground and compromises between different communities. This is exactly what is happening in Russia now. This is exactly what it wants to establish in Ukraine. And then in the whole region of Eastern and Central Europe. And what will happen next? I know that for your country, for Spain, it is important for a democratic system to be protected. For peace on the European continent to be guaranteed. But how can this be possible now? After Russia began to allocate all its state resources to the spread of war and the destruction of any basis of normal life. Just imagine this - mothers in Ukraine write on the backs of their young children the child's name, phone numbers of relatives with the usual pen... Why? Because if the occupiers kill their parents, there will be at least a small chance that someone will save these children. Imagine that people now - in Europe - live for weeks in basements to save lives. From shelling, from air bombs. Daily! 2022, April - and the reality in Ukraine is as if it’s April 1937. When the whole world learned the name of one of your cities - Guernica. Imagine that in ordinary cities, conditions can be artificially created where more than a hundred thousand people live for weeks without water, without food, without medicine. Russian troops blocked our city of Mariupol more than three weeks ago. They are destroying this city completely - there is already nothing there but ruins. More than 90 percent of all buildings were destroyed! The killed people were buried in the yards near the destroyed high-rise buildings where they lived... Russian aircraft bombed even those buildings in Mariupol where they knew exactly people were hiding. Children were hiding... Ukraine speaks about it every day. Every day throughout the days of this invasion. But the war continues. Russia is not serious about peace. What is even worse is that we still do not know how much longer the war will last until the world finally does everything necessary for peace. Really powerful sanctions are needed. The most powerful. How can we allow Russian banks to generate profits while the Russian military tortures ordinary civilians to death in Ukrainian cities? How can European companies trade in a state that is deliberately destroying our people? I know that many of your companies have already stopped financing the Russian military machine through taxes. I want to thank you, your citizens, and your government. I am grateful to these companies, to your entire state and society for the principled stance on sanctions. But at the same time, I want to turn to some companies, such as Maxam, Porcelanosa, Sercobe and other companies - I think you know them better than I do - to stop doing business with Russia. What our city of Bucha, our city of Borodyanka, our other cities have experienced are war crimes. Crimes against humanity. Without statute of limitations. This is an absolutely clear basis for the Russian military and commanders to be convicted by an international court. In these conditions, how can the countries of the world freely buy Russian oil and allow Russian ships into their ports? Ladies and Gentlemen! Spanish people! Now the fate of not only our state is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. But also the fate of the whole European project, of the values that united us all. Us with you. Of democracy that united us all. Of human rights, which have become a fundamental value for all of us. I am grateful to your country for supporting common European decisions for peace. But all of us in Europe, all of us in the world need to do even more to force Russia to seek peace. So that Russia finally starts to respect international law. What is needed for this? Everyone in Europe must simply stop being afraid. Stop being weak. They have to become strong. Put values and democracy above the threats that Russia spreads. I am sure fear is not about you. But I ask you to do everything so that other European countries do not have fear as well. You can help us. Help the world. Give us the weapons we need. And we appreciate that help, that weaponry - all that you have already given us. You can support further sanctions that are needed. And you can also destroy the fear of Russia wherever you can see it. Because democracy should not fear. Freedom must be protected. Human rights must be above all calculations. The right to peace. The right to life. The right to happiness, to free development. The right to family security. The right to the future of children. The right to a decent old age of parents. The right to respect for every community. The right to be with you, Spain, together in a European family. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear members of the Security Council and other participants of the meeting! Thank you for the opportunity. I am sure that all the representatives of the UN member states will hear me today. Yesterday I returned from our city of Bucha, recently liberated from the troops of the Russian Federation. It is difficult to find a war crime that the occupiers have not committed there. The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our state. They executed women outside the houses when approaching and simply calling someone alive. They killed whole families - adults and children. And they tried to burn their bodies. I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased everyday. Everyday, in the morning. The memory of the killed civilians. Who were shot in the back of the head or in the eye after being tortured. Who were shot just on the streets. Who were thrown into the well, so that they die there in suffering. Who were killed in apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Who were crushed by tanks in civilian cars in the middle of the road. For fun. Whose limbs were cut off, whose throat was cut. Who were raped and killed in front of their own children. Their tongues were torn out only because they did not hear from them what they wanted to hear. How is this different from what the ISIS terrorists were doing in the occupied territory? Except that it is done by a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It destroys the internal unity of states. Destroys state borders. Denies the right of more than a dozen peoples on two continents to self-determination and independent state life. Pursues a consistent policy of destroying ethnic and religious diversity. Inflames wars and deliberately wages them in such a way as to kill as many ordinary civilians as possible. To destroy as many ordinary peaceful cities as possible. To leave in the country where it sends its troops only ruins and mass graves. You've seen it all. Promotes hatred at the state level and seeks to export it to other countries through its system of propaganda and political corruption. Provokes a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa and Asia, and will certainly end in large-scale political chaos in countries where food price stability is a key factor of domestic security. So where is the security that the Security Council must guarantee? There is no security. Although there is a Security Council, as if nothing happened. So where is the peace that the United Nations was created to guarantee? It is obvious that the key institution of the world, which must ensure the coercion of any aggressors to peace, simply cannot work effectively. Now the world has seen what the Russian military did in Bucha while keeping our city under occupation. But the world has yet to see what they have done in other occupied cities, in other occupied areas of our country. Geography may be different, but cruelty is the same. Crimes are the same. And responsibility must be inevitable. Ladies and Gentlemen! I would like to remind you of the first article of the first chapter of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? To maintain peace. And to force to peace. Now the UN Charter is being violated literally from the first article. And if so, what is the point of all other articles? Today, it is as a result of Russia's actions on the territory of my state, on the territory of Ukraine, that the most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II are being committed. Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation in them. They are deliberately shooting at columns of civilians on the roads who are trying to escape from the territory of hostilities. They are even deliberately blowing up shelters where civilians are hiding from air strikes. They are deliberately creating conditions in the temporarily occupied territories so that as many civilians as possible are killed there. The massacre in our city of Bucha is just one, unfortunately, of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for 41 days. And there are many other such places that the world has yet to find out the full truth of: Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Borodyanka and dozens of other Ukrainian communities, each of which is like Bucha. I know, and you know very well, what the representatives of Russia will say in response to the accusations of these crimes. They have said this many times. The most illustrative was after the downing of a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas by Russian forces with Russian weapons. Or during the war in Syria. They will blame everyone, just to justify themselves. They will say that there are different versions, and which of them is true is allegedly impossible to establish yet. They will even say that the bodies of those killed were allegedly “planted”, and all the videos are staged. But. Now is the year 2022. There is conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. It is possible to conduct a full, transparent investigation. That is what we are interested in. Maximum access of journalists. Maximum cooperation with international institutions. Involvement of the International Criminal Court. Full truth, full responsibility. I am sure that every state in the UN system should be interested in this. For what? In order to punish once and for all those who consider themselves privileged, consider themselves unpunished. Hence, to show all other potential war criminals in the world that they will inevitably be punished as well. If the biggest is punished, everyone will be punished. Why did Russia come to Ukraine, tell me? I will answer. Russia's leadership feels like colonizers - as in ancient times. They need our wealth and our people. Russia has already deported tens of thousands of our citizens to its territory. Then there will be hundreds. It abducted more than two thousand children. Simply abducted thousands of children. And continues to do so. Russia wants to turn Ukrainians into silent slaves. The Russian militaries are openly looting the cities and villages they have captured. This is looting of the highest scale. They steal everything from food to gold earrings they just rip out with blood. We are dealing with a state that turns the right of veto in the UN Security Council into a right to kill. Which undermines the whole architecture of global security. Which allows evil to go unpunished and spread the world. Destroying everything that can work for peace and security. If this continues, the finale will be that each state will rely only on the power of arms to ensure its security, not on international law, not on international institutions. Then, the UN can simply be dissolved. Ladies and Gentlemen! Are you ready for the dissolving of the UN? Do you think that the time of international law has passed? If your answer is no, you need to act now, act immediately. The power of the UN Charter must be restored immediately. The UN system must be reformed immediately so that the right of veto is not a right to kill. So that there is a fair representation of all regions of the world in the Security Council. The aggressor must be forced to peace immediately. Determination is needed. The chain of mass killings from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped a long time ago to be honest. If tyranny had ever received such a response to the war it had unleashed that it would have ceased to exist and a fair peace would have been guaranteed after it, the world would have changed for sure. And then, perhaps, we would not have a war, a war in my country. Against our nation, the Ukrainian nation. Against people. But the world watched and did not want to see the occupation of Crimea, or even before - the war against Georgia, or even earlier - the alienation from Moldova of the entire Transnistrian region. It also didn’t want to see how Russia was preparing the ground for other conflicts and wars near its borders. How to stop it? Immediately bring the Russian military and those who gave them orders to justice for war crimes in Ukraine. Everyone who gave criminal orders and fulfilled them by killing people will face a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials. I want to remind Russian diplomats that a man like von Ribbentrop has not avoided punishment after World War II. And I also want to remind the architects of Russia's criminal policy that punishment has reached Adolf Eichmann as well. None of the culprits will escape. No one. But the main thing is that today is the time to transform the system, the core of which is the United Nations. To do this, we propose to convene a global conference. And we ask to do it already in peaceful Kyiv - in order to decide. How we will reform the world security system. How we will really guarantee the inviolability of universally recognized borders and the integrity of states. How we will ensure the rule of international law. It is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945 during the creation of a global international security organization have not been achieved. And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms. Therefore, we must do everything in our power to pass on to the next generations an effective UN with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and thus guarantee peace. Prevent aggression and force aggressors to peace. Have the determination and ability to punish if the principles of peace are violated. There can be no more exceptions, privileges. Everyone must be equal. All participants in international relations. Regardless of economic strength, geographical area and individual ambitions. The power of peace must become dominant. The power of justice and the power of security. As humanity has always dreamed of. Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for one of the main offices of the updated security system. Just as the Geneva office specializes in human rights, just as the Nairobi office specializes in the field of environmental protection, the Kyiv U-24 Office can specialize in preventive measures to maintain peace. I want to remind you of our peaceful mission in Afghanistan. When, at our own expense, we Ukrainians evacuated more than a thousand people from this country. And it was the hottest phase. But people needed help - and Ukraine came. Just like other states. We evacuated people of different nationalities, different faiths. Afghans, citizens of European countries, USA, Canada. We did not distinguish who needs help, whether these are our people or not. We saved everyone. If every time there was a need everyone in the world was confident that help would come, the world would be definitely safer. Therefore, Ukraine has the necessary moral right to propose a reform of the world security system. We have proven that we help others not only in good times, but also in dark times. And now we need decisions from the Security Council. For peace in Ukraine. If you do not know how to adopt this decision, you can do two things. Remove Russia as an aggressor and a source of war from blocking decisions about its own aggression, its own war. And then do everything that can establish peace. Or show how you can reformat and really work for peace. Or if your current format is unalterable and there is simply no way out, then the only option would be to dissolve yourself altogether. I am convinced that you can do without the third option. Ukraine needs peace. We need peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace. And finally, I’m asking you to watch the video. A short one. A video of what has come to replace your power because someone alone can abuse his rights. This is what impunity leads to. If possible - watch this video. Because there is no opportunity for everyone to come to us and see it. So watch it. Thank you.

0,"Ukrainians! All our defenders! Today has been a really difficult day. Emotional. I’ve visited our cities in the Kyiv region, which we liberated from the occupiers. Stoyanka, Irpin, Bucha. Of course, now this area does not look like yesterday. The bodies of killed people, killed Ukrainians have already been taken from most streets. But in the yards, in the houses, the dead still remain. The cities are simply ruined. Burnt military equipment on the roads, destroyed cars. It is especially hard to look at the traces of bullets on cars with the inscription ""Children"". We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done. At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city. One of the many Ukrainian communities that the Russian military managed to seize. There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities. In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this. We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible. Everything to punish them. This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court. I discussed this issue today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. And also with Chancellor of Austria Nehammer. We agreed on his visit to Ukraine in the near future. I also discussed the investigation into the war crimes of Russian troops with Polish President Duda. We also talked about new sanctions against Russia, humanitarian and defense cooperation with Poland. All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit. I would like to emphasize that we are interested in the most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which will be known and explained to the entire international community. We provide maximum access for journalists to Bucha and other liberated cities of Ukraine. For hundreds of journalists from around the world. And we are interested in having thousands of journalists there. As many as possible! For the world to see what Russia has done. I'm sure you know about the new old tactics of Russian propagandists who are constantly trying to reject accusations of the Russian military. Why the new old? Everything is simple. Because they used the same tactics when the occupiers shot down a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas. They blamed Ukraine. They even came up with various conspiracy theories. They even went so far as to claim that the corpses were ""thrown"" on board the plane before it crashed. Now they are doing the same thing. The same lies. They are trying to distort the facts. But, as then, they will not succeed. They will not be able to deceive the whole world. The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who of their fellow citizens killed. Who gave orders. Who turned a blind eye to the murders. We will establish all this. And make it globally known. It is now 2022. And we have much more tools than those who prosecuted the Nazis after World War II. We must also be aware that after the revealed mass killings of civilians in the Kyiv region, the occupiers may have a different attitude to their crimes in another part of our country where they came. They are already launching a false campaign to conceal their guilt in the mass killings of civilians in Mariupol. They will do dozens of stage interviews, re-edited recordings, and will kill people specifically to make it look like they were killed by someone else. Probably, now the occupiers will try to hide the traces of their crimes. They did not do this in Bucha when they retreated. But in another area it is possible. I want to say right away: every normal person in the world understands who brought war and mass deaths to Ukrainian land. There is ample evidence that it is Russian troops who destroy peaceful cities, abduct, torture, kill civilians. Therefore, Russian propagandists and their leaders can now succeed in only one thing: making their work enough for the verdict of the future tribunal, which will be similar to the verdict of Julius Streicher, one of the ideologues of Nazism, editor-in-chief of the Der Stürmer weekly. He was executed for anti-Semitic propaganda and calls for genocide. Nowadays people are not executed already. But all skabeevas, evening loudmouths, frontline liars and their bosses in Moscow should remember: the end of your life will be behind bars. At best. I would also like to note the reaction of the leaders of the democratic world to what they saw in Bucha. The sanctions response to Russia’s massacre of civilians must finally be powerful. But was it really necessary to wait for this to reject doubts and indecision? Did hundreds of our people really have to die in agony for some European leaders to finally understand that the Russian state deserves the most severe pressure? This breaks the heart of every Ukrainian. It breaks my heart. Because only now do we hear from all world leaders statements that should have been made long ago, when everything was already completely clear. I emphasize once again: Ukraine must get all the necessary weapons to drive the occupiers out of our land as soon as possible, to liberate our cities. And if we had already got what we needed - all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile and anti-ship weapons, we could have saved thousands of people. I do not blame you - I blame only the Russian military. But you could have helped. I will continue to say this to the face of all those on whom the decision on weapons for Ukraine depends. We have already started preparing all the necessary work to restore normal life in the liberated areas. Mine clearance of the territory is carried out. Our sappers neutralize thousands of explosive devices every day! In the near future we will restore electricity supply, restore water supply to this whole territory of our state. We will provide medical care, normal access to goods - as much as possible in the current conditions. Of course, we will rebuild the destroyed and damaged housing. We will rebuild roads, bridges, infrastructure. Life will come again to every city, to every community that the occupiers tried to destroy. This week I continue to address the parliaments of the nations of the world. Today was Romania. I thanked the Romanian people for their warm attitude towards our migrants. It's true. I called for greater sanctions against Russia. I also said that Romania's leadership was indispensable for ensuring security in the Black Sea region and for restoring justice in Europe as a whole. Tomorrow I will address the Spanish Parliament. And also the UN Security Council. Today I expressed condolences to the President of the Republic of Lithuania and to the entire Lithuanian people over the brutal murder of the world-famous documentary filmmaker Mantas Kvedaravičius by the Russian occupiers in Mariupol. In 2016, he made a film about our peaceful Mariupol, which shortly before found itself on the frontline of the war in Donbas. And now it was there that his life was taken. May the memory of him live forever! We continue to prepare for even more brutal activity of the occupiers in the eastern and southern directions. We know what they are going to do in Donbas. We know what they are going to do near Kharkiv, in some other parts of the country. Russia concentrates a significant amount of military and equipment there. And this activity proves that sanctions imposed against Russia are not enough. There will be more. If the Russian leadership does not begin to really seek peace, really negotiate peace, they will put their country in the worst condition in 50 years. The so-called wicked 90's will seem prosperous and calm. And traditionally, before delivering this address, I signed a decree awarding our Ukrainian heroes. 152 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine received state awards, three of them posthumously. Eternal glory to all our heroes! Eternal memory to everyone who perished for our country! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and gentlemen, deputies and senators, guests! Dear friends! Romanian people! I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and all your people. A few hours ago I returned from the liberated cities of the Kyiv region - near our capital. It is these territories from which we expelled the Russian occupiers and saw what they had been doing to the Ukrainian people on our land. And I want you to see it now. What the occupiers left behind. I apologize - the video is brutal, but it's a reality... The name of our city of Bucha is now forever in world history. In the history of war crimes. In the history of the extermination of people. As of now, we know about more than 300 civilians tortured, executed or otherwise killed in Bucha. Ordinary residents of an ordinary city near Kyiv. Their hands were tied behind their backs, they were shot in the back of the head or in the eye, killed just in the streets. Civilian vehicles were crushed by military equipment. Vehicles with people! They raped women and girls... And this is just the beginning of the investigation. Not all evidence has been collected yet. Not all burials have been discovered yet. Not all basements where the Russian military tortured people have been inspected yet. There is every reason to believe that the number of killed residents of Bucha and other Ukrainian cities nearby will be much higher than what we know today. Why did the Russian military do that? On the same day, April 3, when the world was horrified to see the bodies of those killed in Bucha, an article justifying the genocide of Ukrainians was published on the website of the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Its name is quite eloquent, I quote: ""What should Russia do with Ukraine"". And it's not just text. This is one of the proofs for the future tribunal against Russian war criminals. The article describes a clear and calculated procedure for the destruction of everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians and our people themselves. Those whom they will not be able to break and conquer. It is said that ""de-Ukrainization"" and ""de-Europeanization"" of Ukraine should be carried out. It is said that even the name of our state should be erased. Virtually, it is said that the deaths of as many of our people in the war are only welcomed. I want to emphasize once again: this is the website of the state news agency of Russia, where, under conditions of explicit state censorship, only materials that correspond to the official ideological position on the war against Ukraine can be published. What does not correspond to such a position would simply not pass censorship. I want you to understand me: they are not even hiding. They openly speak about the purpose of the invasion of Ukraine. If our army had not withstood, if our people had not risen to the defense of the state, they would have done what they did in Bucha - but throughout Ukraine. We know about the deliberate killings of teachers and educators in the temporarily occupied territories. We know about deliberate terror against all those whom the occupiers considered as activists, as people related to the army. Even the mere presence of the national symbols of Ukraine, the state flag or coat of arms, in a person's apartment was already a reason for the occupiers to kill this person or at least threaten to kill him or her. But why aren't they hiding? Why do they even now, when everything is clear to the world, openly say how they want to destroy the whole nation? There are two answers to this question. You will understand the first answer very well. In 1989, Nicolae Ceaușescu finally ended his life. For many years it has been clear that this man had lost his adequacy. It has been clear that he, his wife, his entourage, his ""Securitate"" have been dragging your country and people down - to suffering, to poverty, to isolation not just from the world, but from everything advanced in the world. That regime relied only on intimidation, repression, brutality and deception. There was nothing bright in it. The Romanian people revolted and defended themselves, saved themselves. Having overthrown inadequate power. Because that was the only way. Ceaușescu, his wife, his entourage, his ""Securitate"" could not be convinced of anything. It is also impossible to convince those who promote war in Russia now. Who give criminal orders. Who develop plans for the genocide of the Ukrainian people and the destruction of the Ukrainian state. These people are inadequate. They have lost all connection with reality and are willing to sacrifice millions of lives to realize their crazy ideas. And the second reason why Russia is openly calling for genocide and why the crimes of the occupiers that everyone in the world saw in Bucha are possible is the belief of Russia's top officials that European leaders will fail, will be weak. That Europe will lack leadership. And that the nations of Europe are incapable of defending the values that have united the continent. Ladies and Gentlemen! Great Romanian people! Together we must stop these inadequate people who are accustomed to impunity and therefore decided that they are allowed absolutely everything. Together we must stop those who want genocide in Europe. Why must we do this together? Each of you understands that Ukraine is not the last target of Russian aggression. Troops of occupiers are stubbornly trying to bypass our city of Mykolaiv to try to seize Odesa. And from Odesa there is one step to Moldova. Russian state propagandists have long said that Moldova is also a target for Russian expansion. Therefore, the defense of Ukrainians of their own state is a fundamental prerequisite for security and independence of Moldova. And therefore a prerequisite for peace in the whole large region of the Danube. Now the fate of the whole of Eastern and Central Europe and the Black Sea region is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. Therefore, to protect the freedom of Ukraine, to protect the freedom of Ukrainians is to guarantee the security of Europe. What must be done? Yes, it is true, sanctions were imposed on Russia for this war. But the war for our freedom has been going on for 40 days already. After 8 years of war in Donbas. Therefore, sanctions are not enough. Russia must seek peace with Ukraine and with the whole of Europe. To this end, Russia must be deprived of all resources. First of all, financial and economic ones. The European Union must finally adopt a principled decision and close ports to Russian ships. Stop the transit of goods and any economic activity with Russia. Restricting the flow of money for Russian energy has no alternative. One can argue about what the format should be: a full embargo on supplies or a program like ""Oil-for-Food"" - but it is necessary. And not only that. Every politician in a democratic world must defend the need to provide Ukraine with all the necessary weapons. Because it is on the battlefield that it is decided who will be the winner in this war - freedom or tyranny. Everyone on whom it depends must do everything possible to quickly and inevitably bring to justice all Russian servicemen and their commanders guilty of committing crimes against civilians in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Today, I reached an agreement with the European Union on the provision of financial and technical support to the Eurojust Joint Investigation Team, EU member states and the International Criminal Court. I believe that Romania's leadership will be one of the decisive factors in restoring justice and protecting normal life both in our region and in Europe as a whole. I am confident that Romania and Romanian companies will also take part in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction program. We invite our partners in Europe to take patronage over a city, region or industry that has suffered from Russia's aggression. Your potential, your inner strength can create a new example of leadership in building a civilized and peaceful life. I am sincerely grateful to all the Romanian people for their kind treatment of Ukrainian immigrants who have found safety on your land. I hope that together we will be able to create such conditions as soon as possible, when Russia will give up the war, and so our people will be able to return home to Ukraine. And this experience of assistance in emergency situations, mutual respect, kindness between our people has already become the basis for even greater rapprochement of our states, our nations. As soon as the situation allows, I want to start a dialogue with you on a new comprehensive agreement that guarantees the absolute protection and development of our national minorities - the Ukrainian community in Romania and the Romanian community in Ukraine. Because our destiny is to be as close as we can. Our destiny is to be defenders of freedom in our region. Our destiny is to be together in the European family. And I believe that very soon I will be able to address you with words of gratitude for Romania's support for Ukraine's accession to the European Union. Thank you very much! Glory to Romania! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Today this address will be without greetings. I do not want any extra words. Presidents do not usually record addresses like this. But today I have to say just that. After what was revealed in Bucha and our other cities the occupiers were expelled from. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Corpses on the streets. Mined area. Even the bodies of the dead were mined! The pervasive consequences of looting. Concentrated evil has come to our land. Murderers. Torturers. Rapists. Looters. Who call themselves the army. And who deserve only death after what they did. I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians in an ordinary peaceful city tortured to death? Why were women strangled after their earrings were ripped out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? How could their corpses be desecrated even after death? Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible? Russian mothers! Even if you raised looters, how did they also become butchers? You couldn't be unaware of what's inside your children. You couldn't overlook that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure. I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image. Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women to whom you came. I approved a decision to create a special mechanism of justice in Ukraine for the investigation and judicial examination of every crime of the occupiers on the territory of our state. The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Prosecutor General, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other structures within their competence must make every effort to ensure that the mechanism is operational immediately. I call on all our citizens and friends of Ukraine in the world who can join this work and help establish justice to do so. The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth. Everyone guilty of such crimes will be included in a special Book of Torturers, will be found and punished. Ukrainians! I want you to realize that. We drove the enemy out of several regions. But Russian troops still control the occupied areas of other regions. And after the expulsion of the occupiers, even worse things can be found there. Even more deaths and tortures. Because this is the nature of the Russian military who came to our land. These are bastards who can't do otherwise. And they had such orders. All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday. There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land. Today is the fourteenth anniversary of the NATO summit in Bucharest. Then there was a chance to take Ukraine out of the ""gray zone"" in Eastern Europe. Out of the ""gray zone"" between NATO and Russia. Out of the gray zone, in which Moscow thinks they are allowed everything. Even the most dreadful war crimes. Under optimistic diplomatic statements that Ukraine could become a member of NATO, then, in 2008, refusal to accept Ukraine into the Alliance was hidden. The absurd fear of some politicians towards Russia was hidden. They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us. During the 14 years since that miscalculation, Ukraine has experienced a revolution and eight years of war in Donbas. And now we are fighting for life in the most horrific war in Europe since World War II. I want to be understood correctly. We do not blame the West. We do not blame anyone but the specific Russian military who did this against our people. And those who gave them orders. But we have the right to talk about indecision. About the path to such Bucha, to such Hostomel, to such Kharkiv, to such Mariupol. We have no indecision. No matter whether we are in a certain bloc or non-aligned, we understand one thing: we must be strong. Fourteen years ago, Russia's leader in Bucharest told Western leaders that there was no country like Ukraine. And we prove that there is such a country. It was and it will be. We will not hide behind the strong of this world. We will not beg anyone. Honestly, we shouldn’t have asked for help with weapons to protect ourselves from this evil that came to our land. All the necessary weapons should have been given to us anyway - without requests. Because they themselves realized what evil had come and what it had brought with it. We see what’s at stake in this war. We see what we are defending. There are standards of the Ukrainian army - moral and professional. And it is not our army that has to adjust now. These are many other armies that should learn from our military. And there are standards of the Ukrainian people. And there are standards of the Russian occupiers. This is good and evil. This is Europe and a black hole that wants to tear it all apart and absorb. We will win this war. Even if individual politicians are still unable to overcome the indecision they will pass on to their successors together with their offices. And all the necessary services are already working in Bucha to bring the city back to life. Restore electricity supply, water supply. Restore the work of medical institutions. Rebuild the infrastructure. Give security to people. Because Russia was expelled. And Ukraine is returning. And brings life back. Today I visited our border guards, our heroes in the hospital of the Border Guard Service of Ukraine. Wounded warriors. I presented state awards to the eight of them. I also awarded the orthopedist-traumatologist - medical service officer who is a leading military traumatologist in Ukraine and has already saved many Ukrainian defenders. In total, 41 border guards received state awards under this decree. It was the servicemen of the State Border Guard Service who first met the occupiers with fire when they went on the offensive on February 24. Now our boys and girls are returning to the state border as we expel the occupiers. I am sure the time will come and the whole line of the state border of Ukraine will be restored. And for this to happen sooner, we must all be focused, ready to boldly face evil and respond to every criminal act against Ukraine, against our people, against our freedom. Evil will be punished. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Strong people of the indomitable country! Another day of our defense has passed. Another day of many that are gradually, with difficulties, but steadily bringing us closer to peace. To peace that no one will give us a gift. We need to understand it clearly. Because there are no subjects in the world that can stop wars and give peace. The global security architecture has failed. Peace for us will not be the result of any decisions of the enemy somewhere in Moscow as well. We should not cherish empty hopes that they will simply leave our land. We can only gain peace. We can gain it in hard battles and in parallel - in negotiations, and in parallel - in daily vigorous work. Therefore, each of us must continue to do everything we can. In all directions. To support our Armed Forces. To preserve and develop economic activity in Ukraine - as much as possible now. To support all our citizens... Wherever they are, whoever they are. In peacetime warm words sustained the vital forces. And in wartime it is even more important. When we may not even know what a person is going through. What a loss. What help a person needs. But we can see that a person needs help. We need to support this person. We should at least hear this person. Say a few kind words. Something needs to be done to support the life of this person. This must be done. You should be attentive to everyone around you! When people defend themselves in a war of annihilation, when there is a question of the lives or deaths of millions, there are no unimportant things. There are no unimportant moments. Everything matters. And everyone can contribute to the victory of all. Someone with a weapon in their hands. Someone - at work. And someone - with a warm word and help at the right time. So do everything you can for us to withstand together in this war for our freedom, for our independence. For Ukraine to live. Due to such sincere and constant support of each other, due to unity and attention to the neighbor, the people can overcome the most difficult challenges. And drive out the enemy, which is many times bigger in numbers. Our defenders continue to regain control over communities in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. There are more and more Ukrainian national flags in the areas that have been temporarily occupied. The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not release the invaders without a fight. Inflict fire damage. They are destroying everyone we can reach. We are strengthening our defenses in the eastern direction and in Donbas. We are aware that the enemy has reserves to increase pressure in the east. What is the goal of Russian troops? They want to capture both Donbas and the south of Ukraine. What is our goal? Protect us, our freedom, our land and our people. Do everything for protection. Our heroic Mariupol continues to hold back a significant part of the enemy forces. Thanks to this resistance, thanks to the courage and resilience of our other cities, Ukraine has gained invaluable time. The time that allows us to undermine the enemy's tactics and weaken their capabilities. Unfortunately, Ukraine has not yet received enough modern Western anti-missile systems. Has not received aircraft. Hasn’t received what the partners could provide. Could - and still can! Every Russian missile that hit our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended. Decision whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons. I would like to thank the residents of our Enerhodar separately. Those brave Ukrainians who went to a rally today to defend their city. To protect our state. In response, the occupiers opened fire and used grenades against completely peaceful people, which are on their land, within their law. There will be an answer for each wounded person. And the Ukrainian character cannot be conquered by any pressure or violence. I am grateful to everyone who takes to the streets in the temporarily occupied cities. To all who are not afraid and go out. I am grateful to all who are afraid and come out. To all those who feel that without this decision to defend Ukraine and their freedom, the occupiers can gain a foothold. And when people protest - and the more people protest - the harder it is for the occupiers to destroy us, to destroy our freedom. This is our common struggle! And it will be our common victory. I would also like to say a few words to those politicians, some deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine who absolutely do not understand what is happening in the hearts of our people. They don't understand it so much that they even decided to change the national anthem. I have a question for these people: what have you done in your life to give you the moral right to change the words of the anthem? Are you outstanding poets? Maybe you excelled in the battles for Ukraine? Or now is such a time that you can change the anthem whenever you want? Cool down emotions. Stop pretending to be fools. I believe that the authors of these and other similar bills, proposals, should take up arms and go to the battlefield, if you have these opportunities. Only there will you understand something. And even if they accidentally vote for something like this, I still will not sign such bills. Don't waste time. We did not ask for anything special from official Budapest. We didn't even get what everyone else is doing! Doing for the sake of peace. We did not receive the vital transit of defense aid, we did not see moral leadership. We saw no effort to stop the war! Why so? The whole of Europe wants peace. The whole of Europe does not want the battlefield to be moved from Mariupol to Budapest or from Kharkiv to Krakow or from Chernihiv to Vilnius. The whole of Europe is trying to stop the war, to restore peace. Then why is official Budapest opposed to the whole of Europe, to all civilized countries? For what? The main thing for us is the opinion of the people. The Ukrainian people support the Hungarian people. The Hungarian people support the Ukrainian people. We value peace equally, we value freedom equally. It will always be so. We will always live in good neighborliness. And I am convinced that our minorities should be the bridges that unite us even more. Politicians come and go. And the truth remains. That's what I'm talking about - the truth. And I always say what I think. When I am speaking of Hungary, I mean Hungary. And I don't need to mask my thoughts. If we need to speak of Germany, we are speaking of Germany. If I need to speak of another country, I'm speaking of another country. If it's a war, then I call it a war, not a ""special operation."" If this is a threat to the whole of Europe, then I call it a threat to the whole of Europe. I spoke today with the President of Colombia. I am very grateful to him for his support and solidarity with Ukraine. The list of countries that honestly say that freedom matters and the war must stop is expanding. I also spoke with British Prime Minister Johnson. A meaningful, pleasant conversation. We agreed on new defensive support for Ukraine. New package. Very, very tangible support. We also agree on the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Extremely tangible. Agreed on joint steps to achieve peace. Thank you Boris for the leadership! Historical leadership. I'm sure of it. In the afternoon I held a large meeting with the economic bloc of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Office of the President. The economic frontline is another direction of our struggle for our state, for our people. We discussed in great detail the situation with sowing, with the supply of food to Ukrainians, with the supply of fuel, the situation in the energy sector, the situation with the main sectors of the state. The Minister of Finance reported on the state of implementation of the state budget, details of negotiations with partners on financial support for Ukraine. In wartime, economic relations must remain one hundred percent managed, no matter how difficult it may be for all of us. Because it's about perspective. About the perspective of life for more than 40 million Ukrainians, about what our tomorrow will be like. The participants of the meeting received clear tasks. And finally. Already traditional. I signed a decree on state awards to our heroes - the heroes of our state. 131 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, nine of them - posthumously. Eternal glory to them all! Eternal glory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our defenders!  Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our dear defenders! This day, April 1, the occupiers decided to mark with two equally silly jokes. One such joke is about people in Russia. They started the spring conscription, which looks traditional, but is still different from the usual. Because this year's conscripts can be sent to war against our state, against our people. So, this is a guaranteed death for many very young guys. And although they are not our citizens, although they are citizens of the state that is at war with us on our land, it is still our duty as people to warn. Warn each such conscript, their parents. We don't need more dead people here. Save your children so that they do not become villains. Don't send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. At home. At their home. The Russians won’t be told the whole truth about this conscription and about the fate of the conscripts. But still, if you can convey the truth to them - do it. I want to dwell on the fact that the Russian Federation is trying to take people into the army in Crimea. This is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime for which there will be responsibility. And which is also an argument for increasing sanctions against Russia. That's why I want to tell the people of Crimea: sabotage this story. At any stage. And if it doesn't work out, don't fulfill criminal orders and surrender to the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the first opportunity. We will understand everything. You will live. The occupiers played a second very silly April Fool's joke with some residents of the southern regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops had temporarily entered. They appoint some ""Gauleiters"", some temporary leaders. And they are threatening employees of enterprises and authorities to cooperate with these deceived appointees. My message to them is simple: the responsibility for collaboration is inevitable. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is a secondary issue. The main thing is the inevitability that justice will be restored. Therefore, everyone who became a Gauleiter can already register somewhere in Rostov. And there will be problems for cooperation with them or with the occupiers directly. This is the last warning. The occupiers are withdrawing forces in the north of our country. The withdrawal is slow but noticeable. Somewhere they are expelled with battles. Somewhere they leave positions on their own. After them a complete disaster and many dangers are left. It's true. Firstly, the bombing may continue. Secondly, they are mining all this territory. Mining houses, equipment, even the bodies of killed people. Too many tripwire mines, too many other dangers... We are moving forward. Moving carefully. And everyone who returns to this area must also be very careful! It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was. Even in the areas we return after the fighting. You will have to wait. Wait for our land to be cleared. Wait until you can be assured that new shelling is impossible. In the east of our country, the situation remains extremely difficult. The Russian militaries are being accumulated in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction. They are preparing for new powerful blows. We are preparing for even more active defense. We use all opportunities - both internal and external. Necessarily. I emphasize once again: hard battles lie ahead. Now we cannot think that we have already passed all the tests. We all strive for victory. But when it comes everyone will see it. Everyone will feel that peace is coming. In the afternoon I spoke with President of France Macron. About the humanitarian situation in the Ukrainian cities shelled by the occupiers. The situation in Mariupol was discussed separately. For which, I hope, there may still be a solution. Europe has no right to react in silence to what is happening in our Mariupol. The whole world must react to this humanitarian catastrophe. Today humanitarian corridors worked in three regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia. 6,266 people were rescued. In particular, 3,071 people from Mariupol. We are separately agreeing on the removal of the wounded and dead from the city. Our military, our civilians - all citizens. We are talking about this with Turkey as a mediator. Hopefully I will be able to report the details soon. In the afternoon I met with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola. Met in Kyiv. I am grateful to her for this important visit, which demonstrates to some other politicians that courage at a time like this is one of the most important traits for a politician. We talked about how to accelerate Ukraine's accession to the European Union. There are specifics. We also talked about arms supplies and support of European parliamentarians in this. And also about the sanctions policy. About a deeper sanctions policy against Russia. Because if there is an embargo, then it is an embargo. If there is SWIFT, then it is for all banks. And if it is business with Russia, it is not just a suspension of activities, but a complete withdrawal of European companies from the Russian market. Traditionally, I signed a decree on awarding our defenders. Seven servicemen of the State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection. Two of them - posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal gratitude to our defenders! And finally. Tomorrow, April 2, Ukrainian Muslims together with all Muslims of the world will celebrate the holy month of Ramadan. Sincere prayers, mutual forgiveness and good deeds characterize this month. But in Ukraine, another virtue is added - loyalty to brothers-in-arms and your people in battles. In the battles for the freedom of Ukraine. In our war for independence. In which we will definitely win. We will definitely achieve peace. For our entire land. I sincerely wish you peace! Everyone. The whole of Ukraine! All the people of the world. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! The 36th day of our nationwide defense after eight years of war in Donbas is coming to an end. It’s hard to believe that, but March has already passed. Absolutely imperceptible! The passage of time is somehow not even noticed. Every day and every night has become virtually the same for us. The same day, the same night. And with one task for all - to protect ourselves, save people, rebuff invaders. Drive them out. All this March and five days of February, the invaders have been trying to break in and gain a foothold in our house from different directions - from land, from the sky, from the sea. They go, fly, swim... There is so much evil in them, so much thirst for destruction that it reminds not of people, but of something otherworldly. Some monsters that burn and loot, attack and try to kill. Some hellish chimeras. But when you are on your land, everything helps you. The land itself, rivers, every person. Everyone, even the one you didn't expect from before. We endured much more than the enemy expected. They said - three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to seize our entire state. And it’s already 36. And we are standing. And we will continue to fight. Until the end. Until we have strength and opportunities. So that there are no monsters left on our land. So that if chimeras (points to the House with Chimeras - ed.), then native and good. The ones protecting us. I am sure that it is extremely pleasant for each of you to read and watch the news that Ukrainian cities are gradually being liberated from the occupiers. And so it is. Our Armed Forces, the National Police and the National Guard, intelligence are doing great. Absolute gratitude to them! To the north of Kyiv, in the Chernihiv direction, in the Sumy region, the expulsion of the occupiers continues. They themselves are aware that they can no longer withstand the intensity of hostilities they could have maintained in the first half of March. But we must also realize that for the Russian military, this is part of their tactics. All this is not occasional. We know their plans. We know what they are planning and what they are doing. We know that they are moving away from the areas where we are beating them to focus on others that are very important. On those where it can be difficult for us. That is why it is very important for everyone to show restraint. Restraint in emotions. Restraint in worries. We all equally want to win. Equally! But there will be battles ahead. We still have a very difficult path to cover to get everything we strive for. Of course, everyone should motivate our military, each other, and support our defense. Children - with ""likes"". Parents - with a warm word. Volunteers - with help. The people and the state - with all the resources and opportunities that we have, that are available in Ukraine. Restraint in emotions, readiness to fight until we win and proper motivation for our military are essential elements. I also work on motivation for them. Daily. Like each of us. As always, before delivering the address, I signed a decree awarding our heroes. 136 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thank you to everyone! And today another decision was made. Regarding antiheroes. Now I do not have time to deal with all the traitors. But gradually they will all be punished. That is why the ex-chief of the Main Department of Internal Security of the Security Service of Ukraine Naumov Andriy Olehovych and the former head of the Office of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Kherson region Kryvoruchko Serhiy Oleksandrovych are no longer generals. According to Article 48 of the Disciplinary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, those servicemen among senior officers who have not decided where their homeland is, who violate the military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people as regards the protection of our state, its freedom and independence, will inevitably be deprived of senior military ranks. Random generals don't belong here! And to the real heroes of the Security Service - the same absolute gratitude, just as to each and everyone who sincerely defends our state. There are really a lot of heroes among the servicemen. We are grateful to them! The situation in the south and in Donbas remains extremely difficult. The invaders are allocating their sick creativity to the temporarily occupied areas of the Kherson region. They are trying to organize some of their incomprehensible structures there, they are trying to figure out how to consolidate their presence there. Of course, this is hopeless for them. The more active they are there, the more substantial the losses of Russia itself will be in the end. The losses of Russians themselves. Because who else will pay for the occupation of a foreign land? Also in Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. Powerful strikes. We will defend ourselves. We will do everything we can to stop the occupiers and clear our land of their evil and foolish chimeras. Today I addressed the parliaments of our partner countries: Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. I felt total support. I am waiting for concrete steps. I called for tougher sanctions against Russia. We have to put pressure on the aggressor until the aggression is over. I also spoke about this with President of the European Council Charles Michel. We need more support from our partners right now. When the Russian military is concentrating additional forces in certain areas. In addition to sanctions, we discussed with Charles Michel economic support for Ukraine, financing of priority projects. The dynamics of our movement towards full membership in the EU. The sanctions policy was one of the topics of conversation between Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak and US National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan. The United States has imposed a new package of sanctions against Russia. We are grateful. It will not allow the current sanctions to be circumvented - we have already noticed such attempts. It will also limit the work of sensitive sectors of the Russian economy - its defense sector. Let Moscow not forget that the sanctions policy will only be continued and intensified. As long as there is no peace - sanctions are needed. Until Russia begins to invest as sincerely in the search for peace as it invests in the destruction of our state, sanctions will remain unalterable. I also held talks with President of Turkey Erdoğan today. We spoke very specifically. In particular, about the prospects of negotiations in Turkey with the Russian Federation. And also about the creation of an effective system of guarantees for our state. About the security we have always needed and to the real provision of which we have come closer. I am grateful for Turkey's readiness to become a guarantor of security for Ukraine. And finally. Both I and government officials have already said that the ""Diia"" state service has started accepting applications for compensation for the destroyed real estate of our citizens. The state will return to our people everything that the occupiers destroyed - houses, apartments, etc. In a few days, 25,491 applications have already been submitted. The number of residents in these houses and these apartments, which were destroyed, according to our estimates is 63 thousand 471 people. But we know that more needs to be restored. Much more. So tell everyone who needs it about such a government program. An important program. The opportunity to submit applications will soon be available offline, in the administrative service centers, in the mode usual for many Ukrainians. No matter what, we all have to think about the future. About what Ukraine will be like after this war. How we will live. Because this is a war for our future. This is a war for our lives, in which we have only one way - to gain peace for Ukraine. To gain Ukraine's security. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, deputies and members of the government! Dear Belgian people! Eight years of war. 36 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation. Did many people expect that our state and our people would be able to resist Russian troops for so long? Let's be honest: no. Few. They thought we would fall under the blows of Russian troops. But we withstood. Our people endured. We are fighting. We are defending our freedom, amazing the world with the courage of Ukrainian heroes, our Armed Forces of Ukraine and all citizens of Ukraine who do not surrender, who believe in victory. In the south of our state there is a city of Mariupol, which you mentioned today. I am very grateful to you, Madam Speaker. One of the most promising and economically powerful cities in Ukraine. That was before this war. And now more than 90% of all buildings in this city are completely destroyed by Russian strikes - aircraft, artillery, mortars, tanks. Thousands of peaceful Mariupol residents died. People are buried just in the city. In the courtyards of high-rise buildings. Or rather, what is left of the high-rise buildings. Mariupol has been under complete blockade for more than three weeks. The Russian military closed all entrances to the city and blocked access from the sea. You all know these details, there is nothing in the city: no water, no food, no medicine, no life. There is nothing you need to sustain any life. But Mariupol does not give up. Mariupol continues to fight the occupiers. Its defenders had a choice - they could leave the city and give it to the Russian invaders. They did not. Every day we try to do everything to make the humanitarian corridors from Mariupol work! To save civilians who still remain in the city. Women and children, the elderly… In part, we succeed. But in most cases, the Russian military does not release people into the free territory of Ukraine. And does not allow any humanitarian cargo into Mariupol. Today it is the most horrific place in Europe. It is hell. It is a catastrophe that everyone knows about, the whole world. But no one is determined enough to help stop the catastrophe in this city and in other cities in our country. And now I want to ask everyone - I want to ask you, I want to ask all Europeans who hear me now. What do the defenders of Mariupol hope for? What do the defenders of other cities, towns and villages of Ukraine hope for? In all those areas where the battles are no less appalling than you had near Ypres. Or maybe it's even worse in Mariupol... I don't know. Do the defenders of our cities hope for the closure of the skies over Ukraine to Russian missiles and aircraft? They know there is no courage to do so. Do they think about whether our state meets the criteria for joining the European Union? Our state, which has already given thousands of lives in the war for freedom in Europe... Do Mariupol residents or defenders of any other city in Ukraine calculate the level of losses of European companies from the termination of business in the Russian market? Do they think about money at all? No. They do not hope for it. Do not calculate it. Because that's exactly what they deserve. Agree, these are completely different worlds. The world of those who really fight for freedom. Here and now. Against tyranny. Against a tyranny that wants to split Europe and destroy everything that unites us. Everything that unites you... And the world of those who are so used to freedom that they don't even want to notice what the struggle for it is worth. The world of those who believe that Russian diamonds in Antwerp, for example, are more important than the war in Eastern Europe. Or the world of those who believe that the accessibility of European ports to Russian ships is more important than the Russian military machine's attempt to destroy the entire nation around you. 40 million Ukrainians! The main question in the life of every person is not what this person hopes for, what this person thinks or calculates... The main question is what this person is worthy of. And I, as the President of a worthy country, address you with quite logical statements. With what is clear to the vast majority of the world, Europe, Europeans in different countries. We have seen these polls, we know how people support us. Our defenders deserve to receive from Europe for the freedom of which they are fighting the weaponry that will definitely stop Russia's offensive, and therefore the onset of tyranny. When we are talking about aircraft, tanks, artillery systems, anti-ship weapons, we are talking about what is really needed. And what the countries of the European Union, the countries of NATO have. Our defenders deserve that European companies finally stop making money together with those who are trying to destroy us. Our defenders deserve not to think about the criteria, but to know that Ukraine will be a member of the European Union. Because if they lose, if we lose Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities, there will be no strong European Union anymore. Because tyranny will come to take away from you everything you possess and are proud of. Of course, we do not wish you this. And this is by no means a threat. This is the reality. We feel it. This is a statement of all the facts we live in. A statement of what is clearly visible from Mariupol - the headquarters of the European resistance. Of what is clearly visible from Ukraine - the headquarters of European dignity. And I am sure that those esteemed headquarters that are located on your beautiful land are fully aware of everything I am telling you. They realize it. Although, perhaps, they do not speak aloud. So let us all together in Europe be worthy of the feats that Ukrainians demonstrate in the war for freedom. For a free Europe and against tyranny. Against Russia. We are grateful to you, very grateful to your state for the support you have already provided. Belgium was one of the first to provide us with defensive assistance. This is a historical moment, a historical gratitude. We will never forget that. You have already warmly welcomed more than 30,000 Ukrainians who left their homes because of this war. But it is you, as the heart of Europe, who can inspire all other Europeans to do more. To help us drive the occupiers out of Ukraine and restore the precious peace. Peace that is worth more than anything, more than any values, more than any diamonds. More than any agreements with Russia. More than any Russian vessel in European ports. More than any barrel of Russian oil. Each of you knows what needs to be done to restore peace. To be truly worthy of Europe. So help us, do it! Weapons. Sanctions. EU membership. And soon the future will thank you. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to the heroic city of Mariupol! Thank you sincerely to your state! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear members of parliament! Dear Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Defense! Dutch people! I have the great honor of becoming the first foreign head of state to address the House of Representatives of the Netherlands and your people. In this format, at such a time. I am sincerely grateful for this opportunity. For the fact that in these critical circumstances in which my country and our entire continent found themselves, I can explain to you directly what is happening and why it is so important to be together now for all of us, for all Europeans. For all who value peace on our planet. Peace for which millions of people have fought, generations of Europeans. And which was destroyed by one decision, in one moment. So much has been done since World War II so that what Ukraine is experiencing right now never happens again. But everything repeats. Unfortunately. Only so far for one European country, not for the whole continent. But World War II began with the destruction of individual states as well. And then it led to the tragedy of Rotterdam, the terrible bombing of London and the massacre that engulfed all of Europe. If peace on the continent had not been preserved, if the great war had returned with no less brutality than 80 years ago, no one could have a reason to believe that certain state borders would manage to deter aggression. Especially since many in Russia want to carry this aggression further, further to Europe. The shadow of those ruins of Rotterdam is already hanging over many European cities. Ukraine is just the beginning, if Russia isn’t stopped. If we don't stop it immediately! 36 days! 36! That is how long our state, our people have already been fighting alone against the army, which was considered among the strongest in the world. Russia has been preparing for this campaign against us, against freedom, against our people for decades. They have accumulated as many resources to spend on war, on death, as not every European country can spend on life. And now these Russian resources are working at full capacity and, by the way, tirelessly. They work in such a way that... No matter how scary it may sound, people are already getting used to it. The world is beginning to adapt. They start to ignore everything they hear about the war. They are getting used to the news about the new bombing of our peaceful cities. About new missile strikes. They are getting used to the updated lists of those killed. Daily reports of the number of destroyed houses and shelled cities and communities no longer evoke emotions. For many others, the war in Ukraine is becoming routine. Unfortunately, this is true. Routine. But not for those whose lives are in danger every minute. Who, as residents of our city of Mariupol, has been under complete blockade for more than three weeks already. Without everything: without life, without food, water, basic medicines, without communications. Who is forced to stay in basements, hide anywhere just so as not to die under fire. But not for those whom Russia has taken to its territory. Simply deported, as the Nazis did in the occupied countries. Thousands of Ukrainian children and tens of thousands of adults were forcibly transported to the territory of the occupying state. Unfortunately, we do not know anything about the fate of most of them. How to return them? Will they lose touch with their relatives? Will Russia give back these people, these children? These are horrible questions for us. And for some it is becoming a routine that one should not even pay attention to. We are now at a time when we need to act even faster, even more powerfully than during the first month of the war. When the peoples of Europe, the peoples of the world saw what Russia was doing. And they are all full of indignation, full of desire to help. It's true. But people's attention and emotions do not focus on the same thing for long. If the situation is not resolved, people may switch to something else. We have no right to give this war another 36 days! We must all work together to make Russia seek peace as soon as possible! Hundreds of children were killed. Thousands of people were killed. Tens of thousands of houses were destroyed. Burned cities, villages. Russian occupiers rape women in occupied areas. They loot everything they can, everything they find. They even kill not to achieve any military success anymore. Not to sow terror. They started killing because it is fun for them! Entertainment for people who have as many weapons as they want and no deterrents. We will never accept this! And we will never stop defending ourselves! Ladies and Gentlemen! Dutch people! I know that tomorrow your country will celebrate 450 years since the beginning of the armed uprising against tyranny. A fundamental event for your state, for your society. Under normal circumstances, in my address to you, I would talk about it as you are used to hearing it. As about history, a historical moment. As about your heritage. As about the achievements of generations of people who lived 450 years ago. But today, as my country struggles against tyranny, I will speak about it solely as about a current event, as about something that must happen here and now. The faster the better. What was the goal of the founders of the Netherlands? Obviously: freedom, democracy, human dignity, cohesion, cultural, religious diversity. Since then, the path to everything that shows modern Europe has continued. To the free life of dozens of different nations together - in a single space. To tolerance, which provides an unprecedented level of human respect for each other in human history. And all this is now under attack again. All this now needs to be defended again. To be defended in the east of Europe, to be defended in our state, in Ukraine. So far only in Ukraine… So far there is a chance to stop the tyranny on our land and drive it back, beyond our Ukrainian border. I am grateful to you, politicians, I am grateful to all ordinary people for the extremely strong support of my state, our people at this time. For leadership in sanctions. For the principled stance in business activity related to the Russian Federation. For the help you provide to Ukrainian immigrants who have felt family care in your society. This is all extremely valuable! But Russia does not cease hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. Exactly on the territory of Ukraine. And we have to do much more to restore peace. To protect freedom. To save us as a state. And to really ensure one vital fact: there will never be another war in Europe. Never again! In 2014, the world did not fully understand why the Russian occupiers came to our land. Then - to the land of Crimea, partly - to the land of Donbas. And you felt it. After they shot down a Malaysian Boeing flying from Amsterdam. There can be no doubt that this is a totally unjust war. This is a war that the Russian state cannot be forgiven. Hundreds and hundreds of crimes for which everyone must be held accountable. All those who gave criminal orders. Everyone who carried out these criminal orders. And all those who provided political cover for these criminal orders. Your city, The Hague, the capital of international justice, knows exactly how to do it. I'm sure they will do it! To assert international law. To assert the rule of law. To assert justice that is clear to everyone on Earth. But for that to happen, sanctions need to be stepped up. Together with other EU countries, you have to do everything possible so that Russia does not have the resources to continue this war, the war in Europe, and so that there is no political opportunity to hide criminals. Close your ports to Russian ships! Together with all other EU countries. Stop any trade with this country that has forgotten all the lessons of World War II! Get ready faster to give up Russia's energy resources, so that billions, billions of euros for them do not go to arms production and mass killings in Ukraine. Ladies and Gentlemen! Dutch people! Tyranny must lose. Tyranny must always lose. And for that to happen, freedom must get all the weapons it needs to win, to defend itself. The weapons that are available on the continent. The weapons you have. Ukraine is grateful for the support it has already received from you. From your society. From your state. This support is truly unprecedented. It is truly the support of a leader. But the war is so intense, Russian troops are so active that we need more. ""Stingers"" and ""Panzerfausts"" allow you to hold on, to fight. However, this is not a weapon of victory. We desperately need weapons that can make our skies safe, that we can use to unblock our cities where Russia is artificially creating famine. We need weapons that can drive the occupiers out of our land. Aircraft, tanks, NASAMS air-defense systems and Spike anti-tank systems, shells, missiles and more. You have this list. And I hope you will find an opportunity to help us as much as you can, to help us with that. The second point. I urge you to influence international institutions! The crimes of the Russian occupiers must be punished. Deportations, massacres, destruction of civilian infrastructure, bombing of hospitals - all this must be answered by the democratic community. Imagine: Russian troops are deliberately destroying our agricultural sector! They are mining fields, they are blowing up agricultural machinery now. They are doing everything to destroy our potential, agricultural potential, and provoke a food crisis. Not only in Ukraine - in the world. And they are doing it in a country that could become one of the most powerful agricultural centers in Europe and the world. But I am confident that we will be able to overcome all this. I am confident that together we will be able to build even more potential. And become a truly global agricultural power. Third. We already have to think about rebuilding Ukraine. About how we all - not only Ukrainians, but all Europeans - will return to a peaceful life. I dream of this day. The day when Ukrainian immigrants who arrived in the European Union after the beginning of the Russian aggression will be able to say ""thank you"" and return home. Return to rebuilt cities, to restored Ukraine. And I invite your country to join this project - the project of reconstruction of Ukraine. I urge you to choose a city, a region of our state that can see your care, can feel what you can do. And for everyone in your country who still has doubts to definitely feel that we, Ukrainians, can be with you - in the European Union. I am convinced that this will reinforce our common European home. And will make the European project even more perfect. I believe that this will happen very soon! Because it is absolutely rational. With our potential, with our people, with our ability to defend freedom. And you know this perfectly well! And you know very well, my friend Mark, that our accession to the European Union depends very much on you, on your country. I want to thank you for everything! Thank you, the Netherlands! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear leader of the opposition! Ladies and gentlemen, members of the government, senators and members of the parliament! Australian people! Thank you for the great honor of speaking to you today. Impossible, because there is a state that has completely different values than we have, than you have, than the whole civilized world has. And this state started a full-scale war against us. It bombs and shells peaceful cities and villages, killing our peaceful people. Kills children. Arranges blockades of cities, holding hundreds of thousands of people hostage without water, food, light and heat. Daily. It separates thousands of children from their parents and takes them out, or rather kidnaps them, forcibly relocating to its territory. We know that our dream cannot be defeated and destroyed. Especially if we can count on the support and help of the free world. On your support, on your help. And as in the story I told above, it is not needed in a few months, it is needed now. Ladies and Gentlemen! Australian people! The distance between our states is great, thousands of kilometers. We are divided by the seas and oceans, the territories of dozens of other countries, time zones. But this distance simply does not exist for the cruelty and chaos that Russia has brought to Eastern Europe, to the region of our Black and Azov Seas, to our Ukrainian land. Everything that is happening in our region due to Russia's aggression and that is destroying the lives of our people has already become a real threat to your state and your people. Because this is the nature of evil - it can instantly overcome any distance and any barriers. Destroy life. For decades, there has been no such threat of nuclear strikes as there is now. Because Russian officials and state propagandists are openly discussing the use of nuclear weapons against those who do not want to obey Russian demands. For decades, it has not been the case that one state completely blocked the sea for another state and all merchant ships of any country. But that is exactly what Russia has done. Our part of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is now a completely dead sea. And any ship that tries to enter our waters can simply be destroyed by the Russian fleet. More than a hundred merchant ships under various flags are blocked by Russia in our ports! For decades, there has never been a state in the world that has started a war against a neighboring people, openly declaring its conquest or destruction. So that not even the name of this nation remains, so that there is no possibility of free life for this nation. Russia has already returned to the world the worst pages of the XX century. The greatest threats of that century. It returned the evil that humanity has long hoped to forget. But the worst thing is that if Russia is not stopped now, if Russia is not brought to justice, some other countries in the world that dream of a similar war against their neighbors will decide that this is possible for them as well. The fate of global security is being decided now. No human is capable of controlling the wind and precipitation on the planet, and therefore no one will be able to save one or another part of the Earth from radiation pollution due to the use of nuclear weapons. No state on the planet should have even a theoretical possibility to block maritime trade routes and even more so to completely close the sea to other states. I repeat once again: there should not even be a theoretical possibility! No ruler in the world should count on impunity when considering the prospect of war. Ladies and Gentlemen! Australian people! After 36 days of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, it is safe to say that there is no other way in the world to guarantee global security than to force Russia into silence, into peace. And also to bring it to justice - this is important - for everything it has done against global security. A state that does not shy away from nuclear blackmail should immediately receive sanctions that demonstrate that blackmail has devastating consequences for the blackmailer. Effective tools are also needed to bring to justice any state that blocks maritime trade routes. So that no one even has such a temptation - to make the sea dead. Now there are simply no such tools in the world. Therefore, Australia's leadership can be indispensable in modernizing the global security architecture. As well as in strengthening our anti-war coalition, which is now working to return peace to Ukraine. It is also necessary to improve the capacity of international institutions created for the responsibility of war criminals and those who commit any criminal act for which the whole world can punish in solidarity, not just one state alone. If this was done in time, life in the world would be much safer. I am sure that each of you, as well as each of us Ukrainians, remembers the tragedy of MH-17. Malaysian Boeing shot down by the Russian occupiers in the sky over the Ukrainian Donbas. Then 298 people died. My condolences to all the families who lost their loved ones. But was it possible to bring to justice those who caused this tragedy? No. They are hiding in Russia. And, obviously, received security guarantees from the Russian state. Has Russia paid compensation to the relatives of the victims? No. It still denies its guilt in the tragedy. Eight years have already passed and justice has not been restored yet. And no one knows how much longer it will take for at least one tragedy to receive a worthy response from the international community, from all of us. And how many more new tragedies has Russia created or will create? It is often said that unpunished evil returns. I would add: unpunished evil returns winged, with a sense of omnipotence. If the world had punished Russia for what it did in 2014, there would be none of the horrors of this invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We need to fix these terrible mistakes now. I am grateful to Australia for its bipartisan support for our defense against invaders. For the help that your state has already given us. In particular, for 70 thousand tons of coal for the needs of our energy. But this is just the beginning. Together we can, and therefore must do more. New sanctions against Russia are needed. Strong sanctions. As long as it doesn’t abandon nuclear blackmail, the blockade of the sea, it must pay the highest price. No Russian ship should be allowed into the ports of the free world. Buying Russian oil means paying for the destruction of the foundations of global security. Any business activity with Russia must be completely stopped. Not a single dollar for the elimination of people! Any attempt by Russia to circumvent sanctions must also be stopped. After all, what kind of sanctions are these, if they can be circumvented thanks to simple schemes? But above all, we must arm those who are really fighting for freedom. For evil to lose and for Russia to seek peace, Ukraine must have everything it needs on the battlefield. For example, you have wonderful Bushmaster armored vehicles that can significantly help Ukraine. As well as other models of equipment and weapons that can strengthen our position. If you have the opportunity - Ukraine will be grateful to you. Now in Ukraine they will definitely do more for our common freedom, for our common security than being covered with dust on your land. The Ukrainian people have already shown the world how sincerely we value freedom. How consistently we are ready to defend it. Our heroes are fighting against the army that is considered one of the strongest in the world. But all our people, without exception, are already thinking about the future. About how we will live after the war. How we will rebuild our country, our Black Sea region. We invite the world's leading countries, leading companies and the best specialists to join the project of Ukraine's reconstruction. Take patronage of a region, city or industry of your choice in our country that needs restoration. Your state has given Ukraine a special status of a like-minded country. But we are not only related in our thoughts - we are also related in our dreams. Therefore, I invite your beautiful country to look closely at our southern regions, at our coasts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Restoration of our ports, development of such cities as, for example, Kherson, which is fighting for its freedom today, restoration of the maritime industry of Ukraine can be a special contribution to stability for you after this terrible war. Together with the fundamental protection of free navigation, this will restore the strength of the old but correct words: whoever is able to defend freedom at sea, is able to defend freedom in the world. I believe you can do it! And I hope that the Ukrainian community of Australia, our strong Ukrainian community, will join this common work. It will support us now as much as in previous years. Dear friends, the geographical distance between us is insane. Thousands of kilometers. But what does this distance mean for those who have a common understanding, who see the world the same way, who are bitterly disturbed when the enemy comes, when children are killed, when cities are destroyed, when refugees are shot on the roads, when a peaceful country is turned into a burned territory? Then any distance disappears. Geography means nothing. Only humanity matters. Only a dream of returning to a peaceful life. A dream we will fulfill. Definitely. And definitely together. Thank you! Thank you Australia! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear Ukrainians! Today I have few words, not much time, a lot of emotions and even more tasks. It is that kind of moment. A turning point, when we can and should talk only about the most important thing. Yes, there is an ongoing negotiation process. But these are still words. So far no specifics. There are also other words about the alleged withdrawal of Russian troops from Kyiv and Chernihiv. About the alleged reduction of activity of occupiers in these directions. We know that this is not a withdrawal, but the consequences of exile. Consequences of the work of our defenders. But we also see that at the same time there is an accumulation of Russian troops for new strikes in Donbas. And we are preparing for this. We do not believe anyone - we do not trust any beautiful verbal constructions. There is a real situation on the battlefield. And now - this is the most important thing. We will not give up anything. And we will fight for every meter of our land, for every our person. In the current situation of our state, there should be no such discussions to which society and our politicians are accustomed in peacetime. If someone pretends to be able to teach our Armed Forces how to fight, how to resist the enemy, the best way to do it is to go to the battlefield directly. Not from a chair at home or from the place where you left for safety. But from the area of real hostilities. If you are not ready for this, you should not even start teaching our defenders. Today was a very active diplomatic day for me. A difficult one. Priorities are known. There are three of them: weapons for Ukraine, new sanctions against Russia and financial support for our state. A conversation took place with US President Biden. Very detailed, lasted an hour. Of course, I thanked the United States for a new $ 1 billion humanitarian aid package and additional $ 500 million in direct budget support. And I stressed that right now is a turning point. I told President Biden what Ukraine needs. And I was as sincere as possible with him. The support of the United States is vital for us. And now it is especially important to lend a hand to Ukraine, to show all the power of the democratic world. And if we want to fight for freedom together, then we ask our partners ... And if we really fight for freedom and protection for democracies together, then we have the right to demand help in this crucial difficult moment. Tanks, planes, artillery systems... Freedom must be armed no worse than tyranny. I also spoke about this today in an address to the Norwegian parliament and people. To one of the states that supported us significantly. I called for more help to Ukraine. With weapons and sanctions against Russia as well. I spoke today with the President of Egypt and the Crown Prince of the United Arab Emirates. I have done, am doing and will do my best so that our people can defend themselves until justice is restored. On Ukrainian soil and in the Black Sea region. This is our fundamental interest. This is our survival. It is for the survival of the Ukrainian people that we are now fighting. In this war, without exaggeration, the Patriotic War against Russia. And now I want to mention a few more important things. First. There are those who work together with everyone to defend the state. So that Ukraine can gain its future. We appreciate the work of each such person. And there are those who waste time and work only to stay in office. Today I signed the first decree to recall such a person. Such an Ambassador of Ukraine. From Morocco. The Ambassador from Georgia was also recalled. With all due respect: if there are no weapons, no sanctions, no restrictions for Russian business - please look for another job. I look forward to concrete results in the coming days from our representatives in Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. I expect the same results from military attaches in the coming days. The diplomatic frontline is one of the key frontlines. And everyone there must work as efficiently as possible to win and help the army. Each on the diplomatic frontline must work just as each of our defenders on the battlefield. And the second point. Traditionally, today, before delivering this address, at the request of the Commander-in-Chief, I signed a decree on state awards to our military. 122 defenders, 23 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Members of the Government, dear deputies! Norwegian people! It is a great honor for me to address you on behalf of the Ukrainian people. Today is the 35th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After 8 years of war in the east of our state, in Donbas, Russian troops went on the offensive from three directions at once - from the north, east and south. They attacked us on land, in the air and from the sea. Russian missiles and air bombs hit our cities and civilian infrastructure every day and night. There are no forbidden targets for Russian troops. They attack everything. They attack hospitals and airports, food warehouses and residential areas. Ukraine's losses are enormous. Tens of thousands of houses were destroyed, dozens of cities and villages were burned, millions of people were left without the opportunity to live normally. The columns of Russian armored vehicles are not decreasing. Although we have already destroyed more Russian tanks and other combat vehicles than Moscow has lost in any war in the last 50 years. Russia's treacherous actions at sea deserve special attention, as it is one of the greatest threats to international security of all that has emerged since World War II. Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov have been blocked by Russia since the first day of their invasion. About a hundred ships cannot enter the Mediterranean Sea. Some ships were simply hijacked - this is piracy for theft of cargo. Several ships were fired at. But the blockade of ports was implemented by Russia not just by the navy. They mined the sea. And now the mines planted by Russian forces are drifting at sea. And this is a danger for anyone: for any ships and ports of any country in the Black Sea region. One of these mines was recently cleared in time in the Bosphorus. Another - near the Bulgarian border. Another - near the coast of Romania. I don't even want to imagine what will happen if some of these mines are not cleared in time. Who will be affected then? Maybe ferries, God forbid. Or passenger liners. Or merchant ships. Or possibly tankers, the explosion of which could lead not only to human casualties, but also to a large-scale environmental disaster. And then Russia will say again, as always, that it is not them. As it has said many times when killing critics of the Russian government in Europe or even shooting down the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over Donbas. The war is not limited to our borders now. No other state since World War II and the Nazi aggression at sea has posed such a threat to free navigation as Russia has already posed. Think about it - how do they look at it in those regions of the world where there are potential aggressors and new wars with neighbors are quite possible? They are waiting there to see if Russia will be punished enough for its actions. These horrible, aggressive actions. If not, you will see: everything we are experiencing now will be repeated in other regions. Ladies and Gentlemen! Norwegian people! We have no common borders with you, but we have a common neighbor who denies all our common values. For the Russian state in its current condition neither the freedom of nations nor the freedom of human matters. In Russia, universally recognized human rights are denied. It's not that there is no security for minorities, they can just be killed there. And they are being killed. I'm sure you know all about it. You know that there is no rule of law and fair trial. You know that splitting and destroying European democracies is a long-standing policy of the Russian Federation. Russia's war against Ukraine simply continues all this. It is an attempt to destroy everything that Europe is holding on to, what we are holding on to. Therefore, it is an aggression that aims to go beyond our borders. I think you are experiencing new risks near your border with Russia. A number of Russian troops that has no normal explanation has already been amassed in the Arctic region. For what? Against whom? The future of Europe - the whole continent from north to south, from west to east - is being decided right now. On our land, on Ukrainian soil, in Ukrainian air, in Ukrainian sea. So that your soldiers do not have to defend NATO's eastern flank, so that Russian mines do not drift to your ports and fjords, so that your people do not have to get used to the sound of air alarms and so that Russian tanks are not amassed at your border, we must stop the aggression of the Russian Federation together and only together. I am grateful to your Government and to the whole of your society for the tangible support you have already given to our state. Including for the help with weapons. You have taken historic steps by giving us what we need in the struggle for freedom and against tyranny. But the war continues. Russia is sending new forces to our land to continue to destroy us, to destroy Ukrainians. We must do more to stop the war! The first and most important thing is weapons. Freedom must be armed no worse than tyranny. I will be very specific in these walls, in your walls. Believe me, we are losing specific people, specific cities are being destroyed. So I want to make it clear what we need. In particular, anti-ship weapons - Harpoon missiles, as well as air-defense systems - NASAMS. In addition, we need weapons to destroy armored vehicles and artillery systems. All the weapons you can help us with will be used only to protect our freedom, your freedom. Only to protect the freedom and security you enjoy with other Europeans. The second thing is sanctions. The only way that can motivate Russia to seek peace. I am convinced that the country that annually awards the Nobel Peace Prize understands better than anyone else what peace is worth and how we need it. How valuable every effort on the way to peace is. Therefore, new sanctions packages must be introduced weekly, without pauses. The stronger they are, the sooner we will restore peace. I am grateful to Norway for joining the EU sanctions. But I ask you to do something else as well. It is important that European companies do not help this military machine, which has already killed thousands of our people, destroyed dozens of cities completely. No krone, I beg you, no euro of taxes that help Russian aggression! For example, your company MOTUS TECH and other companies must stop supporting Russia's ability to destroy neighbors. How can one supply ship equipment to Russia when it uses its fleet to mine the sea and destroy any opportunities for free navigation? Also, the European Union, and therefore, I hope, Norway, must finally implement a ban on Russian ships using ports on the continent. As long as Russia blocks our ports, it has no right to use all the ports of the free world. I want to emphasize: this is not a question of money, no! This is a question of freedom and security of navigation in the world. Third, you are one of the most responsible suppliers of energy resources in the world. Confidence of the whole world in Norway has always been and I am sure will be at the highest level. This contrasts sharply with Russia's behavior in energy supplies. It is you who can make a decisive contribution to Europe's energy security by providing the necessary resources for both the European Union and Ukraine. We have already started a dialogue on the supply of about 5 billion cubic meters of gas to Ukraine for the next heating season. I hope this will be the basis for our long-term cooperation in this area. Ladies and Gentlemen! Norwegian people! Looking at our common path, we always meet in history in difficult yet defining moments for Europe. Like a thousand years ago, when the Norwegian Vikings were frequent visitors in Kyiv and participated in the formation of the first Kyiv state. Or - Garðaríki. This is what the lands of Rus’-Ukraine were called in Scandinavian sagas. The country of fortresses. The country of cities. Both our and your ancestors lived in them more than a thousand years ago. Today, Russian bombs are flying at our land and our people. At the land where the Ukrainian Princess Elisiv of Kyiv was born and grew up. Wife of King Harald III of Norway, mother of King Olaf the Peaceful, grandmother of Magnus III, great-grandmother of Eystein I and Sigurd the Crusader. These are the pages of our common history! History of Kyivan Rus’. And this history was created on this land and by our people. And we are defending it together again. This was the case 77 years ago, when Ukrainians, along with other peoples of the anti-Hitler coalition, liberated European land from Nazi invaders. Fedir Kompaniyets, a Ukrainian from the Sumy region, was the first soldier to enter the liberated Kirkenes in October 1944 at the head of his unit. Now in his small homeland - in the Sumy region - fierce battles with Russian invaders are taking place. Ukrainians united as much as possible to repel this aggression. To protect our state and our way of life - democratic, free, with full protection of rights and freedoms for everyone. The price is horrible for us - today we know about the death of 145 children, and this is only an officially confirmed number. It is not possible to establish the full number of dead in the occupied areas. It is likely that we have lost hundreds - think about it! - hundreds of children. Just children. After this war we will have not only to rebuild the country physically - rebuild our cities, demine our land, our sea. We will have to rehabilitate people, both military and civilian. Heal after injuries, after everything they had to go through. I know that your country has a lot of experience in rehabilitation. And this is something you can also help us with. And now I invite you to join our project of reconstruction of Ukraine. The colossal losses we have suffered mean that the amount of recovery, the amount of investment required will also be colossal. As one of the world's most responsible investors, Norway can do much to restore stability in Eastern Europe. And then, I am sure, we in Ukraine will be able to adopt one of your extraordinary traditions. A wonderful tradition. The one that characterizes you the most - peaceful people, a society built on the principles of good. Every year on May 17, on Constitution Day, you organize an extremely sincere celebration - a parade of schoolchildren. Children from all over Norway take part in it. This year, our children will go with your children - Ukrainians who came to you for protection and security. And I hope that soon, when we manage to restore peace in Ukraine together, and it will happen, I will be able to invite you, to invite you and your children to take part in such a parade in Kyiv on one of our holidays. To celebrate our common freedom, our common right to a happy future for our children. In peace. In Ukraine. In Europe. Because, as they say, if a rock breaks off from Europe, Europe becomes smaller. So, we must do everything to ensure that a rock like Ukraine is always with Europe. Only together. Thank you Norway! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Wise people of a strong country! The 34th day of the full-scale invasion of Russia and our full-scale defense is coming to an end. Successful defense. I'm sure you saw the news today that the Russian military command allegedly decided to ""reduce hostilities in the directions of Kyiv and Chernihiv."" Well, the same can be said about Chornobaivka - as if the Russian aviation simply decided to fly less, and the Russian military vehicles - to drive less. I am grateful to all our defenders, to all those who ensure the defense of Kyiv. It is their brave and effective actions that force the enemy to retreat in this direction. However, we should not lose vigilance. The situation has not become easier. The scale of the challenges has not diminished. The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state. They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war. Therefore, we stay alert and do not reduce our defense efforts. Both in the north of our state and in all other regions of Ukraine, where Russian troops have temporarily entered. The defense of Ukraine is the number one task now, and everything else is derived from it. It is on this basis that I consider the messages on the negotiation process, which is underway at various levels with representatives of the Russian Federation. The enemy is still in our territory. The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and air strikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts. That is why the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and all those who have joined the defense of the state are the only guarantee of our survival today. As a nation. As a state. The guarantee that works. Yes, we can call positive the signals we hear from the negotiating platform. But these signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells. Of course, we see all the risks. Of course, we see no reason to trust the words of certain representatives of a state that continues to fight for our destruction. Ukrainians are not naive people. Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted. The facts - if they change on our land. Of course, Ukraine is willing to negotiate and will continue the negotiation process. To the extent that really depends on us. We expect to get the result. There must be real security for us, for our state, for sovereignty, for our people. Russian troops must leave the occupied territories. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be guaranteed. There can be no compromise on sovereignty and our territorial integrity. And there will not be any. These are clear principles. This is a clear vision of the possible outcome. And to those on social networks who perceive words as if they are facts already, I want to remind one thing: we live in a democratic state and fight for our freedom. For freedom for our people. Therefore, any decisions that are important for all our people must be made not by one person or a group of people with any political views, but by all our people. The wise people of Ukraine. And certain countries should not even expect that certain negotiations will facilitate the lifting of sanctions against the Russian Federation. The question of sanctions cannot even be raised until the war is over, until we get back what’s ours and until we restore justice. On the contrary, sanctions must be strengthened. Intensified weekly. And they must be effective. Not just for headlines in the media that sanctions have been imposed, but for real peace. Real. And to ensure this, a team of Ukrainian and international experts has already begun work to assess the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed on Russia. On the Ukrainian side, this area is coordinated by Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak, and on the international side by Michael McFaul. During the day the rescue operation was ongoing in Mykolaiv. The debris of the building of the regional administration destroyed by Russian missile strikes was dismantled. As of now, 8 people have been reported killed and 30 wounded. It is likely that these are not final figures. The Russian troops hit Mykolaiv very insidiously. At a time when people came to their workplaces in the morning. Thank God, most of those in the building managed to evacuate when they heard an air alarm. This one more act of the Russian so-called denazification of Mykolaiv took place in the morning after the anniversary of liberation of the city from Nazi invaders. Mykolaiv residents remember the day of March 28, 1944. And they see who the Russian troops trying to capture their city now look like. I spoke about Mykolaiv today in my address to the Danish Parliament and the Danish people. I invited the society of this country to take part in the reconstruction of the city and the region after the war. In the framework of our program of Ukraine's reconstruction, we involve partner states, leading companies and the best specialists in order to guarantee the speed and quality of the reconstruction of our state. As I was told, this proposal was very positively received in Denmark. There is also important news from our government officials. As of today, the new functionality of our ""Diia"" state service will be available. As I promised, the state will compensate for the loss of a house or apartment as a result of hostilities. Every citizen of ours can already submit an application in ""Diia"". Applications are already available in the mobile application. You need to update the app to see this new service. And in a week it will be available offline - in the centers of administrative services. In itself, the functionality in ""Diia"" is quite convenient. But all the necessary details will still be clarified by our government. The main thing is that the state will compensate for every meter of lost real estate. In addition, government officials today expanded the program to help those institutions that support IDPs from the areas of hostilities. Another important decision was to allocate 426 million hryvnias to pay the miners' salaries. Traditionally, I signed several important decrees before delivering this evening address. The first is about awarding communications service employees. I am sincerely grateful to everyone who provides the fundamental basis of our lives. Who gives us connection. By the way, on the day of the beginning of the Russian invasion, the first missile strike in the JFO area was made against them. 12 people were awarded state awards, 4 - posthumously. The second signed decree is on awarding 126 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 34 of them - posthumously. We will always be grateful to each of our defenders for the defense of our state in the Ukrainian Patriotic War against Russia. May the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine live forever! Glory to each of our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Members of the Government and the Folketing! Danish people! 40 missiles. Every day, Russian troops use so many different but equally deadly missiles against our state, against Ukraine. This is the average number per day. 40. More than 1,370 missiles have been used in just over a month of Russia's full-scale invasion of our land. This morning the Russian missiles hit one of our southern cities - Mykolaiv. The city of shipbuilders. Absolutely peaceful city, which dreamed of only one thing - to regain the glory of the center of shipbuilding in the Black Sea region. As a result of this strike, the building of the regional administration was destroyed. It is known that seven people were killed and 22 were wounded. Debris removal continues. The Mykolaiv region residents didn't have any military dreams. They posed no threat to Russia. But they, like all other Ukrainians, believe me, have become a target for Russian troops. For missiles, bombs, rocket artillery, mortars. The total number of means of destruction that Russian troops have already used against our people on our land is simply impossible to count. But we can say that the intensity and brutality of the hostilities against us have reached a level even higher than during World War II. The most devastating war for Europe. A month of hostilities - and we already have not one or two, but a whole black list of cities that were completely destroyed by Russian bombing. In dozens of other cities, towns and small villages, residential areas were partially burned, infrastructure was destroyed and enterprises where people worked were blown up. Living, ordinary people. 773 educational institutions - universities, schools, kindergartens - were destroyed. 773. Imagine! And dozens of hospitals, churches, even memorials to Holocaust victims have become targets... The goal of Russian troops in this war is to completely destroy any basis for the normal life of the Ukrainian people. The occupiers are deliberately making sure that nothing is left of Ukraine. Only ruins. Only refugees. More than 10 million Ukrainians have already fled their homes due to the hostilities. Almost 4 million Ukrainians have left our country, most of them women and children. The stories of these people are full of horror. There are still many burned and shot cars on the roadsides in the areas where the Russian military came. Hundreds and hundreds of such cars, what’s left of them. The occupiers were killing civilians even when they were just trying to escape! Along with our immigrants in Europe and the western regions of Ukraine, there are children who were simply picked up on the road near the corpses of their parents. Up to 100,000 people remain in our city of Mariupol, which has been blocked by Russian troops for more than three weeks. While there was snow people melted it to get water. All this time we can't deliver humanitarian goods to the city - they are simply blocked. Water, food, medicine. Everything is blocked by the Russian military. More than 90 percent of all buildings in Mariupol were completely destroyed by shelling and bombs. But Russian aircraft strike without stopping. They purposefully blow up even shelters, although they know for sure that peaceful people are hiding there - women, children, old people. What Russian troops are doing to Mariupol is a crime against humanity that is being committed live in front of the eyes of the entire planet. Why is this even possible? Why can't the world stop this flow of Russia's war crimes ongoing since February 24 this year? The answer is very simple and cynical. People who make decisions in Russia hope that they will get away with it. Sanctions? They think they can be bypassed. An embargo on Russian oil? They see that this is still nothing more than just talking about this important topic. And concern, constant concern. An international tribunal? They know that it takes years to bring specific perpetrators to justice. That is why we appeal to you and to the entire democratic community of the world: sanctions against Russia must be strengthened! Constantly. We need to give up Russian oil, we need to block trade with the Russian Federation, we need to close ports for Russian ships. And this must be the solidarity policy of the European Union, of all the member states. Everyone. It is you, in Denmark, in the country where the basic principles of the European Union, the Copenhagen criteria, come from, who can feel most of all how important it is for all-European solidarity to work for pressure on Russia. Because this pressure is for Russia to seek peace. This is pressure to give the necessary protection to all the basic values on which life in Europe is built and which are now completely trampled by Russia in Ukraine. What can be said about the protection of human rights or freedom on the European continent, if there is no such crime against people and humanity in general not committed by the occupiers? They deport our people to Russia by force, rape women, underage girls, and engage in looting. They have already taken more than two thousand children to Russia, and we do not know where they are, we do not even have a complete list of these children. Do they have families? How will they then find their loved ones? It would be simply impossible for a normal person to imagine the level of evil that was brought to our land! That is why I call on you to raise the issue of solidarity in the defense of freedom, in the defense of humanity at the level of the European Union. There can be no Russian branches in Europe that split the EU from within, that are trying to help Russia make as much money as possible even now. Everyone knows very well who in the European Union opposes humanity and common sense. Who does nothing at all to help establish peace in Ukraine. This must stop, and Europe must stop listening to any excuses from official Budapest. I am grateful to Denmark for its principled position. Thank you to everyone. I am grateful to your people who help Ukraine and help Ukrainians. To your companies that have decided to leave the Russian market. Maersk, Jysk, Lego, Vestas, DSV, Arla Foods, Carlsberg and many other companies who have made this important decision. But I ask you not to stop, to be leaders in Europe in promoting the decisions we really need. Long before this war, it was clear that humanity should reduce the use of fossil fuels. The era of coal and oil has caused huge damage to the environment, to our planet as a whole. Green technologies and green energy have become a logical and just answer to this challenge. European policy is already aimed at reducing the consumption of environmentally hazardous resources. But Russia's aggression against Ukraine and against everything that life in Europe is built on is an argument to accelerate green transformation on the continent. Europe must give up Russian oil, give up as soon as possible! Because it is the crazy income from energy resources that allows the Russian leadership to be bold. Violate generally accepted rules. Promote hatred against other nations, against us and destroy the lives of neighboring countries. If you had to find the complete opposite of what is called the ""Law of Jante"" in your country, it would be the ""Law of Russian Oil"". I am confident that together - only together with all Europeans, with all responsible states on the planet - we will be able to overcome this catastrophe. We will be able to return to peace. We will be able to live together in a European family. I hope this will happen very soon. But it depends on how consistent and principled we remain at this time. At a time when the war continues. However, we have no right now to think only of war. We know there will be peace. We know that we will be able to return to a normal, peaceful life. That is why I want to invite you to join our initiative to rebuild Ukraine after the war, after our victory. We invite your companies, your specialists, your state. Knowing your potential, your creative economic power, I offer your country to take patronage over one of our beautiful regions - after the war. Of course, after the war. Mykolaiv, the city of shipbuilders, can become such a city, such a region, which will unite you and us even more. Which Denmark can help rebuild. Ladies and Gentlemen! Danish people! Now is the dark time in Ukraine. Thousands of candles are placed in our churches in memory of the people whose lives were taken by this war. I know that for you the warm light of candles is a synonym of home comfort, ordinary good human life. Life, which today has become an unattainable dream for many in Ukraine. The Russian invasion continues. But I believe, I know, that we can return to peace. And I ask you to light a candle at home tonight in memory of all Ukrainians whose lives were taken by Russian aggression. May the memory of all who gave their lives for our freedom, world freedom, live forever! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Wise people of a strong country! Today we have good news. Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, regaining control over Ukrainian territory. Irpin was liberated. Well done! I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result. The occupiers are pushed away from Irpin. Pushed away from Kyiv. However, it is too early to talk about security in this part of our region. The fighting continues. Russian troops control the north of Kyiv region, have the resources and manpower. They are trying to restore the destroyed units. The level of their losses, even at 90%, is not an argument for them to stop. Hundreds and hundreds of units of burned and abandoned enemy equipment do not convince them that this will happen to everyone. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, Donbas, southern Ukraine - the situation everywhere remains tense, very difficult. This is a ruthless war against our nation, against our people, against our children. As of today, 143 children are known to have died. Mariupol remains blocked. Russian troops did not allow any humanitarian corridor to be organized today, they did not allow ""silence"". Therefore, the situation must now be perceived in a balanced, wise way. As much as possible. Without excessive euphoria from success. But also without getting yourself worked up. We still need time. We still need weapons. We still have to fight, we have to be patient. We can't burn emotions right now. We can't set expectations too high. Just so as not to burn out. I spoke with the leaders of the partner countries. It was a very active diplomatic day. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson, Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau, Chancellor of Germany Scholz, Prime Minister of Italy Draghi and President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. We agreed with Britain to further support our defense and strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation. Canada also supports a tougher response from the world to the catastrophe created by Russian troops in Ukrainian cities. In a conversation with German Chancellor Scholz, I also paid considerable attention to the need to increase sanction pressure on Russia. I thanked the President of Azerbaijan for the humanitarian support provided to Ukraine, informed about the state of affairs in the territories where Russian troops entered. Italy has agreed to become one of the guarantors of Ukraine's security in the relevant new system of guarantees that we are elaborating. I will continue this activity tomorrow. I will talk to other world leaders. I will work with international organizations, with the nations of Europe and the world. Ukraine cannot and will not agree with the passive sanctions position of some entities towards Russia. There should be no ""suspended"" sanctions packages - that if the Russian troops do something, then there will be some answer... We went through this story last year when we said that strong preventive sanctions against Russia were needed to prevent an invasion. The preventive package was not made. A full-scale war has begun. There are now many hints and warnings that sanctions will be tightened, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, if Russia uses chemical weapons. There are simply no words. Just think about what it all came down to. Waiting for chemical weapons... We, living people, have to wait… Doesn't everything that the Russian military is doing and has already done deserve an oil embargo? Don't phosphorus bombs deserve that? Don't the shelled chemical production or nuclear power plant deserve that? It is important for us that the sanctions packages are effective and substantial enough, given what is already being done against Ukraine by the Russian Federation. If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership that they can continue to afford what they are doing now. And Ukrainians pay for it with their lives. Thousands of lives. Therefore, starting this week, we are creating a group of experts at the President's Office - Ukrainian and international, who will constantly analyze the sanctions against Russia - what they really influence. Our goal is for the sanctions to work as intended. And so that there is no possibility to circumvent them. This must be a goal for the whole democratic world, without exception. No exception. During the week I will speak in the parliaments of the partner countries: Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia. It is important that these are speeches not only in front of politicians, but also in front of societies. In front of millions of people who want to hear Ukraine and are ready to hear it to help and support. Who feel that we are fighting for our common freedom. One for all people on our earth. I will emphasize everywhere that no one has the right to use the lives of Ukrainians to save any income in Russia or income common with Russia. And Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine. Fear always makes you an accomplice. If someone is afraid of Russia, if he or she is afraid to make the necessary decisions that are important to us, in particular for us to get planes, tanks, necessary artillery, shells, it makes these people responsible for the catastrophe created by Russian troops in our cities, too. Because if you could save, you had to save. The peoples of Europe, the peoples of the world will definitely hear and support me. And all politicians should think now what they will have left if they do not correspond to the position of their people. And finally. Already traditional. Just before delivering this address to you, dear Ukrainians, I signed two important decrees on awarding servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with state awards. At the request of our Commander-in-Chief, 302 of our defenders are awarded. I am grateful to all of you for your service! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Strong people of our strong country! Today is the day when we see again and again how far we are from the Russian Federation. Imagine, they were frightened there in Moscow because of my interview to Russian journalists. To those of them who can afford to tell the truth. When journalists were preparing to publish our interview - and we spoke with them this afternoon - the Russian censorship agency came out with a threat. That's what they wrote - they demand not to publish the conversation. It would be ridiculous if it wasn't so tragic. They destroyed freedom of speech in their state, they are trying to destroy the neighboring state. They portray themselves as global players. And they themselves are afraid of a relatively short conversation with several journalists. Well, if there is such a reaction, then we are doing everything right, then they are nervous. Apparently, they have seen that their citizens have more and more questions about the state of affairs in their country. The maximum contrast is my conversation with our favorite Ukrainian TV media representatives. I held a zoom conference with almost five hundred of our media representatives who are creating a telethon ""United News"". I am grateful to them. Although we were limited in time, we talked quite thoroughly. I felt that everyone cares about Ukraine, cares about us and you, cares about our future. I wrote down a lot of questions and suggestions - we will work them out. Today I supported the global marathon for peace in Ukraine. Not just a television one. In dozens of cities around the world, people gathered in support of our state, in support of freedom. That’s a pleasure! An impressive number of people in the squares of Europe, on other continents. And this is extremely important. Because when people are in the square, politicians will no longer pretend not to hear us and you, not to hear Ukraine. I will continue to appeal to the parliaments of other countries. The week is planned to be very busy from a diplomatic point of view. Therefore, no one will be able to hide the Ukrainian interest somewhere in political offices or in bureaucratic loopholes. We will not let anyone forget about our cities, about Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that the Russian militaries are destroying. More and more people in the world are on the side of Ukraine, on the side of good in this battle with evil. And if politicians don't know how to follow people, we will teach them. This is the basis of democracy and our national character. Once again I want to thank our people in Kherson, Kakhovka, Slavutych and other cities who do not stop resisting the occupiers. If the occupiers had temporarily entered Ukrainian cities, it only means that they would have to leave. And I want to remind those phenomenal fools who are trying to cooperate with Russian troops that they are leaving their own people behind. What will they do to other people's traitors? I would tell them: think about it. But I know that these people don’t have anything to think with. Otherwise they would not have become traitors. Of course, this week we will work for new sanctions against the Russian Federation, against the aggression, sanctions that are needed as long as Russian troops remain on the territory of Ukraine. A new round of negotiations is ahead, because we are looking for peace. Really. Without delay. As I was informed, there is an opportunity and a need for a face-to-face meeting already in Turkey. This is not bad. Let's look at the result. Our priorities in the negotiations are known. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory. Our goal is obvious - peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible. The Armed Forces of our state are holding back the occupiers, and in some areas they are even taking steps forward. Well done. The courage of our defenders, how wisely they behave on the battlefield... This is so important that no words of gratitude will be enough. But again and again I never tire of thanking. To each of our defenders... To all who fight for our future, for our children, for our people. I signed decrees conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine upon 15 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 3 of them posthumously. As well as a decree on state awards to 142 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 5 servicemen of the Department of State Protection of Ukraine. It is a great honor for me to sign such decrees. May the memory of all our heroes live forever. May the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine, for us, live forever. Glory to you all! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Free people of a free country! Free Slavutych who will not be conquered by the invaders! Today we were all with you - on your streets, in your protest. And all together we tell the occupiers one thing: go home while you can still walk. The Russian invaders entered Slavutych and faced the same reaction there as in the south of our state, as in the east of our country. Ukraine is united in its desire to live freely, to live independently and for the sake of its own dreams, not other people's sick fantasies. Every day of our struggle for Ukraine, every manifestation of our resistance in all areas the occupiers have entered so far proves that Ukraine is a state full of life, which has historical roots and moral foundations throughout its territory. Nothing they do will help the occupiers in the Ukrainian territory they temporarily entered. Disconnection of our television and activation of passionate nonsense speeches by Moscow TV presenters, leaflets with propaganda, distribution of rubles. Rubles, which in Russia will soon be weighed instead of assessing them at face value. Bribing outcasts whom the occupiers are looking for in all the dumps to portray the allegedly pro-Russian government will not help as well. The answer to Russian troops will be one - hatred and contempt. And our Armed Forces of Ukraine will inevitably come. That is why ordinary Ukrainian peasants take captive the pilots of downed Russian planes that fall to our land. That is why our ""tractor troops"" - Ukrainian farmers take Russian equipment in the fields and give it to our Armed Forces of Ukraine. In particular, the latest models that Russia has tried to keep secret. And now the occupiers leave them on our land and just run away... Actually, they do the right thing. Because it is better for them to escape than to die. And there are not and will not be other alternatives. Everyone in Ukraine has united and has been devoting all their energy to the defense of our state for more than a month already. Together with the Armed Forces, together with all our defenders, together with our National Guard. I would like to once again congratulate the National Guard of Ukraine on its day with great respect. I am sincerely grateful for everything you do to protect the state, to protect Ukrainians! Thank you for all the steps to victory that will come and that were made possible thanks to you. Today I presented awards to soldiers of the National Guard who distinguished themselves in battles with the Russian occupiers. I also awarded the rank of brigadier general to five colonels of the National Guard of Ukraine. In total, during the full-scale war since February 24, 476 soldiers of the National Guard have been awarded state awards already. I also spoke today with Polish President Andrzej Duda. Twice. About our people who found protection in Poland. And the need to strengthen our common security. Security of our states. Security for all Europeans actually. What is the price of this security? This is very specific. These are planes for Ukraine. These are tanks for our state. This is anti-missile defense. This is anti-ship weaponry. This is what our partners have. This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities. After all, this is all for freedom not only in Ukraine - this is for freedom in Europe. Because it cannot be acceptable for everyone on the continent if the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia and the whole of Eastern Europe are at risk of a clash with the Russian invaders. At risk only because they left only one percent of all NATO aircraft and one percent of all NATO tanks somewhere in their hangars. One percent! We did not ask for more. And we do not ask for more. And we have already been waiting for 31 days! So who runs the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it still Moscow because of intimidation? And, by the way, we talked today with our military in Mariupol, with our heroes who defend this city, in Russian. Because there is no language problem in Ukraine and there never was. But now you, the Russian occupiers, are creating this problem. You are doing everything to make our people stop speaking Russian themselves. Because the Russian language will be associated with you. Only with you. With these explosions and killings. With your crimes. You are deporting our people. You are bullying our teachers, forcing them to repeat everything after your propagandists. You are taking our mayors and Ukrainian activists hostage. You are placing billboards in the occupied territories with appeals (they appeared today) not to be afraid to speak Russian. Just think about what it means. Where Russian has always been a part of everyday life, like Ukrainian, in the east of our state, and where you are turning peaceful cities into ruins today. Russia itself is doing everything to ensure that de-russification takes place on the territory of our state. You are doing it. In one generation. And forever. This is another manifestation of your suicide policy. Our representatives - the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Defense of Ukraine - met today in Poland with colleagues from the United States. They were joined by US President Joseph Biden. As I was informed, the negotiations concerned, in particular, these vital interests, which I mentioned above. Concerned what we really need while this ping-pong continues - who should give us planes and other protection tools and how. Ukraine cannot shoot down Russian missiles using shotguns, machine guns, which are too much in supplies. And it is impossible to unblock Mariupol without a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles and, of course, aircraft. All defenders of Ukraine know that. All defenders of Mariupol know that. Thousands of people know that - citizens, civilians who are dying there in the blockade. The United States knows that. All European politicians know. We told everyone. And this should be known as soon as possible by as many people on earth as possible. So that everyone understands who and why was simply afraid to prevent this tragedy. Afraid to simply make a decision. Vital decision. Of course, we have already seized a number of Russian tanks, which the military command of this country keeps sending to be burned here. However, the nations of the world will not understand for sure if the battlefield in Ukraine will be a larger supplier of tanks to protect freedom in Europe than our partners. Ukraine's position must be heard. I want to emphasize: this is not only our position. This is the position of the vast majority of Europe's population, the majority of Europeans. If someone does not believe me, look at current public opinion polls in the world. And if you do not want to hear the opinion of the people, then hear the strikes of Russian missiles hitting right next to the Polish border. Are you waiting for the roar of Russian tanks? I also spoke with Prime Minister of Bulgaria Kiril Petkov. In particular, about the humanitarian catastrophe due to the actions of Russian troops and how to save our people. I spoke today at the Doha Forum in the capital of Qatar. This is a respectable meeting that is important not only for the Islamic world, but also for many other countries in Latin America and Africa. These are the regions where Russian propaganda still has great influence. But we are working against lies all over the world. Let Russia know that the truth will not remain silent. And let every nation in the world feel the depth of Russia's injustice against Ukraine. Against everything that keeps the world within morality and humanity. The occupiers committed another crime against history. Against historical justice. Near Kharkiv, Russian troops in their branded inhuman style ""denazified"" the Holocaust Memorial in Drobytsky Yar. During World War II, the Nazis executed about 20,000 people there. 80 years later they are killed a second time. And Russia is doing it. The menorah in Drobytsky Yar destroyed by Russian projectiles today is another question to the entire Jewish community of the world: how many more crimes against our common memory of the Holocaust will be allowed to be committed by Russia on our Ukrainian land? Russian troops are deliberately killing civilians, destroying residential neighborhoods, targeting shelters and hospitals, schools and universities. Even churches, even Holocaust memorials! Russian troops receive just such orders: to destroy everything that makes our nation nation, our people - people, our culture - culture. This is exactly how the Nazis tried to capture Europe 80 years ago. This is exactly how the occupiers act in Ukraine. No one will forgive them. There will be responsibility. Just like 77 years ago. Most likely not in Nuremberg. But the meaning will be similar. You will see. Everyone will see. Everyone. We guarantee. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear Ambassador Herbst, dear ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for having me here. I’m grateful for the chance to talk to you. People of Ukraine are grateful to our American friends for all the help you provide. Both military and humanitarian. Thanks for your support. It’s really vital for us. Yesterday, after the NATO summit I was told a joke. The NATO acronym stands for Never Act, Talk Only! They say the joke is so old that it should be called vintage.  And now allow me to get to Ukrainian. Today, it’s the language of freedom. The language of victory. If this is true, then things are bad for us. More precisely, they are bad for NATO. Because if it reacted to Russia's aggression against itself in the same way as it had reacted to the invasion of Ukraine, Russian tanks would be standing near Dunkirk for a couple of weeks already. And someone - we know for sure, who exactly - would probably have to land in Normandy again soon. But NATO is lucky - these tanks are now being disposed of in Ukraine. But the thing is Ukraine is not made for this. Ukraine has other plans, its own plans. To develop. To build. To continue reforms. To improve life. These plans are not just paused. For thousands of people, they will never come true. They may never come true for our entire state. After all, the war that Russia is waging against us is not just a war for territory or resources. This is a punitive war. Caused by the desire to return the apostates who rebelled against the ""Russian world"". Or to destroy them. For the Putin regime, Ukraine is a heresy. Literally. And the war against it is a religious war. So this is a war of annihilation. Russia's goal is to destroy Ukraine. As a people living by their own customs. As a political nation that chooses its own values. As a sovereign state that determines its own path. There is no exaggeration in these words. They must be taken literally. Because this is exactly what the Russian leadership meant when it has been talking about ""one nation"" for years. About Ukraine as a ""historical phantom"" and ""not even a state"". Henry Kissinger, a man I respect very much, has grasped very clearly the essence of Russia's attitude toward Ukraine. I quote in the original language: “The West is trying to establish the legality of any established border. For Russia, Ukraine is part of the Russian patrimony”. Now the world is promoting the ""Give Peace a Chance"" campaign, and there are calls for reconciliation between Ukraine and Russia. We did not start this war. We want its end more than anyone in the world. We are making an incredible effort to do so. In particular, the diplomatic one. However, the word ""reconciliation"" is completely inappropriate here. It indicates parity and equality of the parties. We see an emphasis on supremacy on the part of Russia. And the intention to continue on the path of violence and destruction. The Kremlin's aggressive plans are failing. The blitzkrieg failed. No strategic task of the invading force was fulfilled even during the month of fighting. They believed that the invasion of Ukraine would be an easy walk. They believed that they would quickly stifle our desire for freedom. Well, they have a lot of experience in this. They have Berlin 53rd, Budapest 56th, Prague 68th… But they have forgotten that the CSTO is a pale shadow of the Warsaw Pact. Russia is a pale shadow of the USSR. But it still has very large resources. In particular human resources. Half a million soldiers subdued Czechoslovakia. 200,000 have been sent to seize Ukraine. Yet. And a new wave of invasion is approaching. And maybe it will be bigger. In Russia, covert mobilization continues. Russia's allies are trying to avoid participating in its aggression. But blackmail and provocations can still force them. And this means we will have to defend ourselves further. But it is already quite obvious: the Russian leadership has miscalculated about Ukraine. Miscalculated at each point. Because the line ""we will lay down our souls and bodies for our freedom"" is not just solemn words from our national anthem. This is the Ukrainian national idea. We do not just believe that freedom is the highest value. We know that. In 2014, this knowledge was embodied in the slogan ""Ukraine is Europe"". Of course, this is not about geography - everything is obvious about it. It's about values. But today Ukraine is the Grail of Europe. Without exaggeration. Because it is Ukraine who revives the principles that gave life to the current civilization of the West. You can't exchange freedom for comfort. You cannot buy resources for justice and human rights. Cannibalism cannot be justified by originality. You cannot be afraid to call evil evil. You can't be afraid of evil. We are not afraid. And this is what makes Ukraine an antagonist of Russia. The anti-Russia that Putin talks about all the time. And in this sense, our state is an indisputable existential threat to him. Because his loss in Ukraine will mean the collapse of the regime. And success will only strengthen it. Terror is the basis of his regime. Terror is the basis of Russian statehood. Terror is the basis of Russia's military strategy. Russia is a terrorist state. The Russian armed forces are destroying our cities not only because of technical backwardness and lack of high-precision ammunition. They are doing it to cause horror. Phosphorus bombs dropped on the Kyiv region are not about military superiority. The methodical destruction of Mariupol is not about military superiority. There were more people in Mariupol before the war than in Miami. Imagine Miami without water. Without access to medication. Without food. Imagine Miami being turned to dust every day. Together with residents who are not allowed to evacuate. Neighborhood after neighborhood. Schools. Theater. Maternity hospital. Without any military sense. Just to intimidate. They are destroying civilian infrastructure and using unconventional weapons to cause a humanitarian catastrophe. They resort to chemical and nuclear blackmail - the threat of environmental catastrophes due to sabotage at the captured Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants remains extremely high. They are hiding behind civilians. Tens of thousands of them are being taken hostage and taken to work in the depressed regions of Russia. They call it evacuation. In fact, it is an abduction. That is why I call on the partners: it is time to recognize the Russian Federation as a terrorist state. Officially. It is time to recognize the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation as a terrorist organization. It is time to recognize them as a criminal organization. But this, apparently, will not happen as long as the seat in the UN Security Council is illegally occupied by a state that has carried out aggression against one of the founding states of the United Nations. This will not happen as soon as the world's largest and most powerful defense alliance is most concerned about avoiding confrontation with a regime that has been breaking the world's security system for years. The attack on Ukraine has become a vivid completion of this process. That's why we have to endure. For ourselves. And for the world. Because it will only get worse. Unpunished tyrannies multiply lawlessness. They do not need the rule of law. They recognize only the rule of force. Russia understands only the language of power. Its success in Ukraine will only strengthen the Kremlin's claims. On the territory. On the restoration of the Soviet sphere of influence. On the right to dictate to other nations how to live. Ukraine will hold on. For us, this war is a people's war. Therefore, we will not give up our sovereignty or territories. But we cannot afford Pyrrhic victory. You can't afford that. Destroyed and bloodless Ukraine will cease to be what it is today. It will cease to be an advanced bastion of the European fortress. To survive, we need very specific things. You know what I'm talking about. But we have to remind people about it every time. I'll start with the simplest. It is very important to be in time in war. It is important to have time. The more the better. Give it to us. We really need to share intelligence in real time. A clear and complete picture of Russia's actions is very much needed. This is extremely important for our defense. Two factors are bringing our victory closer. The first is our resilience. Courage of every fighter. Every volunteer. Every citizen. The second has many names - Javelin, Stinger, Mark-19 and so on. But small arms and portable weapons, no matter how modern, are of limited effectiveness. Without a full-fledged Lend-Lease, without heavy weapons - long-range artillery, MLRS, etc. - the defensive war against Russia will turn into a guerrilla war. Simply due to the number of its mobilization reserves. This increases the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe and is guaranteed to increase the outflow of refugees. We must avoid this at any cost. Finally, we need to close the sky. Here we see several options. And they all depend primarily on the political will of the parties. The basic option is to transfer Soviet and Russian-made fighter jets and long-range air defense systems to Ukraine. Relevant reserves are in Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Greece. They could hand them over to us, and the United States could strengthen their defense by providing a replacement. The temporary deployment of Patriot systems and air police missions could protect these countries from hostile actions and provocations from Russia due to the transfer of weapons to us. The vast majority of citizens of the United States and other countries stand for increasing support for Ukraine. Including the military support. And the number of such people is growing every week. It is time for politicians to listen to the opinion of their own people as soon as possible. Russia's success is ensured by fear. It is fear that motivates it to further aggression. It is restrained only by determination. And it's time to show it. Do not give in to blackmail. Don't give in to panic. Don't give in to terrorists. Ukraine will resist. Ukraine will continue to fight. Not only against the aggressor. But also for the future. For reliable guarantees of post-war security. We are not satisfied with any configuration that threatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We will not be satisfied with a compromise on Russian terms. The victim of aggression must not pay for peace. The aggressor must be deprived of the opportunity to attack again. That is why we call on our partners and allies to find a format that will work effectively and for a long time. We have learned the lessons of the Budapest Memorandum. We have paid very dearly for them. This war has totally destroyed the entire old system of international security. We need to build a new one now. And Ukraine has proved that it deserves to be not only its participant and founder, but also its leading participant. And we continue to pay dearly for this right. And now it's time for the aggressor to pay. We call for the sanctions regime to be strengthened. We call for the strict observance of sanctions. We call for the introduction of mechanisms that will make it impossible for international companies to circumvent sanctions. Give the world a model that will deprive Russia of the opportunity to pursue an aggressive policy for many years to come. Not only after the end of the active phase of hostilities on the territory of Ukraine. We call for an embargo on Russian energy. We call for the reduction of opportunities of gray and black imports to Russia through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union. Russia is not a trade or agricultural state, but a military one, and its vocation is to be a menace to the world. These words belong to Emperor Alexander II. But every ruler of Russia could say them. And especially - the current ruler. It's time to stop this wheel of history. Before he does that. Everything will be Ukraine.

0,"Strong people of the best country in the world! I want to begin this address with words of congratulations. On my own behalf and on your behalf, on behalf of all our citizens of Ukraine to the employees of the Security Service of Ukraine. Today is their day. 30 years ago, on March 25, the Security Service of our state was founded. The Service has come a long way. And we all know that. But we also know that during the eight years of the war in Donbas and during the 30 days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many members of the Security Service have shown themselves from the best - heroic - side. They have shown themselves principled, courageous and able to inflict losses on the enemy that the enemy does not expect. This is exactly what Ukraine needs now. I am grateful to all our heroes from the Security Service of Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone in the Service who during 30 years of our common history broke the plans of enemies and worked in the interests of the Ukrainian people only. Congratulations on the holiday! Respect to everyone! And we will always remember all the employees of the Service who died for Ukraine while performing tasks to counter Russian aggression. During this month of hostilities, 77 employees of the Security Service were awarded state awards. Two of them were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Both distinguished themselves in the battles near Makariv, Kyiv region. Thanks to their courageous actions, the enemy headquarters and more than 20 occupiers were destroyed. I can't tell you the names of our heroes. This is the specifics of the service. But I can say with confidence: the memory of them will truly be eternal! Today I signed a decree on state awards to 63 law enforcement officers of Ukraine. Seven of them were awarded posthumously. Police, rescuers, border guards, special service officials of the State Bureau of Investigation and employees of the Court Protection Service. Thank you to everyone! Over the past week, our heroic Armed Forces have dealt powerful blows to the enemy, significant losses. They say that the Minister of Defense of Russia has disappeared somewhere… I wonder if he personally wanted to visit Chornobaivka? I am grateful to our defenders who showed the occupiers that the sea will not be calm for them even when there is no storm. Because there will be fire. As on those Russian ships that departed this week on the famous route from the port of Berdyansk. I want to warn all traitors of Ukraine who sided with the enemy in Crimea years ago. You switched sides because you thought you would live better, right? Not because you want to repeat the tragic fate of your colleagues who died on those ships or somewhere else on land or at sea in Ukraine. Well, live. Stay as far away from our cities and our army as possible. The number of Russian casualties in this war has already exceeded 16,000 killed. Among them are senior commanders. There have not been reports about killed Russian colonels-general or admirals yet. But the commander of one of the occupying armies and deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet are already there. The Armed Forces continue to repel enemy attacks in the south of the country, in Donbas, in the Kharkiv direction and in the Kyiv region. By restraining Russia's actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful. Urgent. Fair. For the sake of the result, not for the sake of the delay. 16,000 Russian servicemen have already died. For what? What does it give and to whom? The conversation must be meaningful. Ukrainian sovereignty must be guaranteed. Ukraine's territorial integrity must be ensured. That is, the conditions must be fair. And the Ukrainian people will not accept others. During the week we managed to establish 18 humanitarian corridors. A total of 37,606 people were rescued from the blocked cities. In particular, 26,477 Mariupol residents were evacuated from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia via the humanitarian corridor. The situation in the city remains absolutely tragic. The Russian military does not allow any humanitarian aid into the city. They only use Mariupol residents in fakes for their propagandists. Pretending to start giving something to people. I will continue to inform the nations of other countries in great detail about such disgusting cynicism of the occupiers, about all the war crimes of Russia against the civilians of our heroic Mariupol and other cities of Ukraine. It is very important. I want to emphasize: not only politicians and government officials, but nations. Everyone on the planet needs to know what Russia is doing. So that the responsibility for crimes against the Ukrainian people becomes inevitable and as severe as possible for the Russian military. During the week alone, I addressed the parliaments of Italy, Japan, France and Sweden. I spoke at the summits of NATO, the G7 and the leaders of the European Union. Each of these speeches attracted maximum attention in the respective countries and in the world as a whole. The reviews show that the Ukrainian position was heard. And this is my main goal in such speeches. You know perfectly well what a powerful system of state propaganda Russia has built. They have spent and are spending tens of billions of dollars on it. Probably no one in the world has ever spent such crazy money on lies. But they did not take into account one thing. Where the path of lies needs to be paved with money and the result is not guaranteed, the path of truth is difficult, but the path of truth paves itself. The main thing is to be honest. Next week I will continue this important work for our interests. Interests of Ukraine. Interests of freedom and independence. I had a conversation today with Turkish President Erdoğan. The results of the NATO summit were discussed. Of course, we also talked about the efforts that could bring peace closer to Ukraine and end this senseless Russian invasion of a foreign land. There is important news from our government officials. First. They have already started paying pensions for April. In particular, the Pension Fund has transferred to Oschadbank the entire amount of pensions for the Chernihiv and Luhansk regions. Tomorrow people will have money on their bank cards and Ukrposhta will deliver cash. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, the payment of April pensions will continue in other regions of Eastern and Central Ukraine. The other day a wave of payments will cover the entire state. This is one of our priorities: the Ukrainian state has fulfilled and will fulfill all obligations to our citizens, to our pensioners. Second. Under the eSupport program, more than 20 billion hryvnias have already been paid to people who have lost their jobs or the opportunity to have business. The amount of payment is 6,500 hryvnias. Third. Officials are preparing a new support program for our IDPs from the war zones. Regional administrations have been given a clear task to quickly allocate land for the construction of temporary housing for displaced persons. I want to emphasize once again - this is temporary housing. Once we establish peace, we will begin the immediate, large-scale reconstruction of our state. But now people need a temporary home. Their home. And it is better to have a home in Ukraine than somewhere abroad. We pay aid, we give a job. Native people. Native country. All the details of this support program will be presented by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. And a few more words about the path of truth. About those who bring you and us true information about everything that is happening in our country. I would like to express special gratitude to our journalists today. To all those who ensure the work of the national telethon ""United News"", to all our media people. Correspondents, presenters, editors, media managers, cameramen, directors, video editors, make-up artists, producers - everyone without whom it is impossible to imagine television. Everyone who united and together with other defenders of our people provides Ukrainians with truthful information and, last but not least, confidence 24/7. I am grateful to all of you! And, I'm sure, I can say this on behalf of all Ukrainians. Glory to you all! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

With each day of our defense, we are bringing the peace we need so much closer. We are bringing victory closer. Because in this war it is simply impossible for us not to win. And it will be so. And we can't stop even for a minute. Because every minute is about our destiny, about our future. About whether we live or not. The 30th day. It's been a month! If Russia had known it would face that, I’m sure they would have definitely been afraid to come here. During this month, we’ve withstood all the main directions of Russian strikes. The world has applied destructive sanctions. And we are reaching an agreement on new ones. Today I have delivered some important speeches. To the participants of the NATO summit, the G7 summit, to the summit of the leaders of the European Union. To the Swedish Parliament. All this is for the sake of support for our state. We need it for our protection. I informed the President of Egypt about the current situation. And today I signed some very important decrees. On awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to seven servicemen of the National Guard, to five of them, unfortunately, posthumously. Also on state awards to 240 servicemen of the National Guard of Ukraine and 119 servicemen of the Armed Forces. On state awards to 14 heads of local communities, local authorities. On state awards to 31 medical workers. And on awarding the honorary title ""The Hero City of Ukraine"" to four more cities: Bucha, Irpin, Okhtyrka, Mykolaiv. You know, after signing these decrees, I felt that it would really be worthwhile to award and confer the title of hero to millions and millions of our people. To you, to all Ukrainians who are doing everything they can for the sake of victory. For peace. In a place where they are. And I am grateful to each and every one of you. To each and everyone for this month of great struggle. And, of course, to our Armed Forces, of course, the National Guard, our border guards, doctors, rescuers, territorial defense, reconnaissance officers, special services and many, many people, representatives of other professions who save our lives.

0,"Greetings to all of you, greetings to all our friends, friends of Ukraine! Greetings to all who support freedom! I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and the nations of Europe. Today it’s already been a month since the Russian invasion. After 8 years of aggression in Donbas. The month of the great war. In short, about its chronicle. Because everything is in my head and everything is fragments. Unfortunately, tragic ones. It all started on February 24. From Russia. When the missiles flew. Early in the morning. Against our peaceful cities. People have still been sleeping. Death has already come. Russia sent armored vehicles against us. Brought several thousand tanks to Ukraine. It’s hard to count how many of them have already been burned. How many can still kill us. Bombs fell on our people. From planes that took off from Belarus. And they didn't even admit that they did it. Russia captured the Chornobyl NPP. Staff have not been released for 24 days there. Imagine, people lived 24 days at such a facility, worked at such a facility. These are our people. So that nothing terrible happens in Chornobyl again. To prevent the catastrophe. And the Russian military held them hostage. Russian tanks fired at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia fired missiles at Babyn Yar. It has already destroyed more than 230 schools and 155 kindergartens. Killed 128 children. Fired missiles at universities. Burns residential neighborhoods with rocket artillery. Whole cities, villages. Just to ashes. Nothing remains. The Russian military killed journalists. Although they saw the inscription ""Press"" on them. They may not have been taught to read. Only to kill. Russia has blocked Mariupol. This is a blockade that no one could have imagined in our time. Hundreds of thousands of people without water, without food. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing. The Russian militaries deliberately blow up hospitals, maternity hospitals, shelters. They even blow up shelters, imagine! Knowing for sure that people are hiding there. They killed 96-year-old Borys Romanchenko in Kharkiv. A Russian projectile flew into his apartment. Into the apartment of a man who survived the Nazi concentration camps, but could not survive Russia that went to our Ukrainian Kharkiv. Thank God, our military stopped Russia there. Russian troops are using phosphorus bombs - it was this morning. Rape women. Loot houses. Destroy churches! All churches. Even those of the Moscow Patriarchate. Abducted more than 2,000 children from Ukraine. We don't know where our children are, where our 2,000 children are. Fire at humanitarian convoys. They don't care who's there. Children, women, church representatives who accompany the humanitarian cargo. They kill people in Donetsk and say it's us. They say it's us, the ""nationalists"". Russia is doing all this. For a month already. On our land. And Ukraine? What is Ukraine doing? It did not go to a foreign land. Never dreamed of any war. Shoots down missiles. Urges strangers to lay down their arms and return home. For the sake of life. Do you understand? For the sake of life. Not death. Heals and feeds war prisoners. Allows them to contact their relatives by phone. Collects the corpses of Russian soldiers from the fields, which they simply leave, abandon. Hundreds and hundreds. Ukraine has united for peace. And for the sake of peace it unites the world. Tries to unblock the besieged cities. Maintains the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Even in the presence of the occupiers. Calls on the IAEA to intervene and patiently explains to the international bureaucracy what is happening. Evacuates people from dangerous areas. Does not stop trying to deliver humanitarian aid. Records Russian war crimes. Gathers evidence. Invites journalists. Maintains the functioning of all institutions of a normal state. Defends its own country! And every morning... Do you hear me? Every morning, the whole state, the whole of Ukraine - children, grandparents - everyone honors the memory of all those who died for our state with a moment of silence. Have you heard anything like this on Russian television? Have you seen this in their schools? They are even ashamed of the word ""war"". They call it a ""special operation"". Although they organized a massacre here, as the Nazis did. These are different worlds. We and they. These are different values. This is a different attitude to life. The Russian military does not see what dignity is. They do not know what conscience is. They do not understand why we value our freedom so much. This is what determines how the country will live. And who should be in Europe. And what about the European Union? I want to thank you - you are united, united around us. But I want to say that it was done in one way or another. But once again, the main thing is that you have united. And we really appreciate that. You have applied sanctions. We are grateful. These are powerful steps. But it was a little late. Because if it had been preventive, Russia would not have gone to war. At least no one knows for sure. There was a chance. You blocked Nord Stream 2. We are grateful to you. And rightly so. But it was also a little late. Because if it had been in time, Russia would not have created a gas crisis. At least there was a chance. And now you and I are preparing Ukraine's membership in the European Union. Finally. Here I ask you - do not be late. Please. Because during this month you have compared these worlds, and you see everything. You saw who is worth what. And you saw that Ukraine should be in the EU in the near future. At least you have everything for that. And we have this chance. Lithuania stands for us. Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us. France - Emanuel, I really believe that you will stand for us. Slovenia stands for us. Slovakia stands for us. The Czech Republic stands for us. Romania knows what dignity is, so it will stand for us at the crucial moment. Bulgaria stands for us. Greece, I believe, stands with us. Germany... A little later. Portugal - well, almost… Croatia stands for us. Sweden - yellow and blue should always stand together. Finland - I know you are with us. The Netherlands stands for the rational, so we’ll find common ground. Malta - I believe we will succeed. Denmark - I believe we will succeed. Luxembourg - we understand each other. Cyprus - I really believe you are with us. Italy - thank you for your support! Spain - we’ll find common ground. Belgium - we will find arguments. Austria, together with Ukrainians, it is an opportunity for you. I'm sure of it. Ireland - well, almost. Hungary... I want to stop here and be honest. Once and for all. You have to decide for yourself who you are with. You are a sovereign state. I’ve been to Budapest. I adore your city. I have been many times - very beautiful, very hospitable city. And people, too. You have had tragic moments in your life. I visited your waterfront. I saw this memorial… Shoes on the Danube Bank. About mass killings. I was there with my family. Listen, Viktor, do you know what's going on in Mariupol? Please, if you can, go to your waterfront. Look at those shoes. And you will see how mass killings can happen again in today's world. And that's what Russia is doing today. The same shoes. In Mariupol, there are the same people. Adults and children. Grandparents. And there are thousands of them. And these thousands are gone. And you hesitate whether to impose sanctions or not? And you hesitate whether to let weapons through or not? And you hesitate whether to trade with Russia or not?  There is no time to hesitate. It's time to decide already. We believe in you. We need your support. We believe in your people. We believe in the European Union. And we believe that Germany will also be with us at the crucial moment. Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen! The world's greatest democracies represented by you! First of all, I would like to thank Chancellor Scholz and the German presidency for the opportunity to address you today. At this urgent summit. Today is exactly one month since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Russia, which was present at this format together with advanced democracies. Then the G7 was the G8. And there were a lot of hopes for its participation, for a dialogue with Russia. I want to emphasize that most of those hopes, as well as the place next to the Group of Seven, Russia received in advance. And it still hasn't deserved this advance. But this and other similar advances gave the Russian leadership the impression that they would get away with anything. In recent years, the Russian state has created so many crises and such instability that it has now become a major problem for the world. A problem that is only growing. And you and I still have no idea how many more such urgent summits will have to be held before the problems created by Russia are resolved. Europe is going through a war, every day of which is full of war crimes of Russian troops. This morning I received information that Russian troops had used phosphorus bombs against civilians in Ukraine. The threat of large-scale use of chemical weapons by Russia on the territory of Ukraine is quite real. We are trying to find out the exact number of deported Ukrainians. People who are forcibly deported to Russia on a daily basis are deprived of documents, means of communication - everything is taken away - and distributed among their regions. And even then Russia tries to mobilize them into its army! It illegally abducts children. According to our data, more than two thousand already! Ukrainian cities - Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka and other cities - look like a global catastrophe. They are ruined. The roads from these cities, which people used to escape, resemble the set of a post-apocalyptic movie with hundreds of burned and shot cars. But it is true: there is a global catastrophe! Russia has destroyed the global security architecture and dealt a powerful blow to international relations. But this is just the beginning. This war may be followed by a global food crisis. The longer there is no peace on Ukrainian land, the less food the world market will receive from Ukraine. Consequently, many countries in Asia, Africa, and even Europe, may have extraordinary problems with access to basic products, with food prices. This will definitely result in political destabilization. Maybe this is also the goal of the Russian leadership? I do not know. We must all act immediately! Immediately stop Russian troops, remove them from the territory of Ukraine. Peace is needed immediately before the world faces an even greater level of problems. It is better now to tighten sanctions against Russia as much as necessary to stop its military machine than to deal with the consequences of the food and political security global crisis. Unprecedented challenges! If so, a full embargo on trade with Russia is needed. It is necessary to deprive Russia of the opportunity to use GPS in war. It is very important. So that this system does not help Russian missiles and bombs destroy peaceful cities. Russian banks and, most importantly, the Central Bank of Russia must get a complete blockade from the global financial system. War criminals should be left without money at all! And their frozen assets should turn, inter alia, into reparations for the reconstruction of Ukraine. It is better to give Ukraine the kind of weaponry support we really need now than to look for weapons for other countries later. We mean Georgia, Moldova, the Baltic States, Poland and Central Asia. The sooner this happens as we ask, the sooner there will be peace in Eastern Europe. This is in our best interest. This is in your best interest. This is in the interests of all democracies. Because democracies must be able to defend themselves. Freedom must be armed. Life must overcome death. And I emphasize this: no advances to such a Russian state! Never again. Any steps towards it or towards any other violator of international law should take place only after their steps towards peace, towards universally recognized rules. And on the basis of a system of preventive deterrence. I am grateful to you for the unprecedented unity. For your resolute support for peace for our country, for our people. I am grateful to those of you who are trying one hundred percent to stop this war. I believe we can do it. We will be able to make your Group of Seven not just the Great Seven, but the Great Seven of Peacekeepers. What do we need for this? Ukraine is very specific in answering this question. First - to intensify sanctions against Russian aggression on a weekly basis until it stops and restores peace for us. Second - to take part in the creation of a new system of security guarantees for Ukraine, for our region. Real guarantees. Effective. Those that can stop any aggressor in 24 hours. We offered to create an association - U-24. This is what the world really needs. Not just to preventively stop the war or hostilities that have already begun. But also to provide assistance to the states that were affected by the natural disaster, that need to be supported during a pandemic, that are facing migration or food crises. The world needs new effective alliances! New effective guarantees! This can support developing democracies. This can support the economies of countries where there are no stable institutions yet. And third - which directly concerns our state and Eastern Europe. We must rebuild our state together as soon as possible after the war. Rebuild cities. Restore economic life. Bring people back. I offer you to participate in such a project. Recovery project. I am sure it will be in our common interest. But first - weapons for Ukraine. First - increase sanctions against Russia every week. That is, peace comes first. We have the strength to do it. You have the strength to do it. So, may there be peace! I am grateful to everyone who supports us. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"It is a great honor and opportunity to address you today. Greetings also to the Prime Minister! To the Swedish Riksdag MPs and members of the Government! Swedish people! Now the blue and yellow flag in the world is probably the most popular. These colors are associated with freedom. This is true for different people on different continents. And of course in Europe. The blue and yellow colors of the national flag are not just about Ukraine. This is about you as well, about Sweden. And obviously this is not a coincidence. This is fate. Because we are equally for freedom. We are equally for a peaceful life. We are equally for respect for everyone. We are equally for justice and equally for caring for the natural world in which we live. Therefore, it is logical that Sweden is now among those who support Ukraine the most. And I am sincerely grateful to each of you for this. Today is exactly the month of the worst ordeal - the full-scale war waged by Russia against our state. Europe has never known such a dark month since World War II. It has not seen such destruction and such war crimes. The list of those killed already reaches thousands. Dozens of our cities and communities were destroyed. Russian troops do not distinguish between civilian and military targets. They destroy everything. They burn residential neighborhoods and houses. They blow up hospitals. They even fire at kindergartens with rocket artillery! Hundreds of educational facilities and more than 200 schools were destroyed. Russian troops bombed universities. Imagine - they destroy any infrastructure that simply serves life. Warehouses with food and medicine. They seized two nuclear power plants. Yesterday they hit the second chemical production already. Phosphorus bombs were used today! Both adults and children were killed. What is the purpose of such actions of Russia? What is the reason of such terror against us? This is an attempt to conquer the whole nation. An attempt to make the neighboring state a slave. Ladies and Gentlemen! Swedish people! Modern Europe, which has finally become peaceful, is built on clear principles. Namely: there can be no forced border revision. And every nation has the right to choose its own future - without dictatorship, without coercion, without occupation. Thanks to these two principles, we in Europe have had an unprecedented era of cooperation. Peace. Confidence. We had it until the Russian leadership decided that it could travel in time. That it allegedly could cancel the 21st century. Allegedly could act as in the old days of totalitarian ideologies. If Ukraine failed to endure, defend itself, it would mean that everything we, living and modern people, value was lost. Everything you value. Everything that is valued by any free people of any state. This would mean that all of Russia's neighbors are in danger. This would mean that you are in danger, because only the sea separates you from this aggressive policy of this state. And Russian propagandists are already discussing on state television how Russia is occupying your Gotland island in particular. And how to keep it under control for decades. They show it to the Russians on the map, show the directions of the offensive... You may ask for what purpose? They say it will be beneficial for Russia to deploy air defense systems and a military base in Gotland. To cover the capture of the Baltic states. Russia went to war against Ukraine because it expects to go further to Europe. Expects to destroy freedom further in Europe. This is a fundamental challenge for the European security system. Please take a look at what the Russian military has already done in our country. 8 years of war in the east. Occupation of Crimea. This is repression. Torture of people, suppression of all manifestations of freedom and diversity. A month of full-scale war. Total cruelty. The bombing of peaceful cities is as terrible as it was in Syria. Abduction of children. Forced transportation of children and adults to Russia. Rape in the occupied areas. Large-scale looting by the Russian military. Now tens of thousands of houses and tens of thousands of apartments have been destroyed. And there are already almost ten million migrants, three and a half million of them in the European Union. I deliberately do not want to call these Ukrainians refugees. Because I know that they will return to Ukraine. As soon as Russia leaves our land, as soon as peace is established. Ladies and Gentlemen! Swedish people! Sweden was one of the first to come to our aid. I am grateful to you! Your support is absolutely sincere. It is based on values. On our love for freedom. On what our blue-yellow national colors symbolize. The whole world knows what Sweden wants. The whole world has seen in a month of this shameful war what Ukraine wants. We are together in our anti-war coalition. And we must do everything to make Russia seek peace. Sweden has made a historic decision to provide Ukraine with the necessary weapons. We thank you for that! For your prudence. For your foresight. Sweden supports the sanctions policy. A policy without which there will be no peace. Because the Russian leadership will not understand any language other than effective sanctions. But for peace to come faster, sanctions packages against Russia must be applied on a weekly basis. Not a single barrel of Russian oil! No Russian ships at your ports! Not a single euro of taxes of your companies in Russia! Their military machine must be left without means of subsistence. Deliberate actions of Russian troops to destroy civilians in Ukraine, to destroy our peaceful cities must receive an inevitable and principled response from all European countries. From the free world. This has already become the typical feature of Russian troops... Syria, Ukraine... Massacres. Cities destroyed to the ground. Phosphorus and other prohibited munitions. To prevent this from becoming a victorious strategy, all war crimes must be punished. Those who gave the order to kill and those who killed must face the Tribunal. So that no other country in the world thinks that it can kill people with impunity just like that, that it can destroy neighboring countries. I am confident that together we will be able to ensure peace, and that is why we must now think about rebuilding Ukraine after this war. And it will happen! I invite Swedish architects, Swedish companies, the Swedish state, your people to take part in this historic project. Ukraine was beautiful. But now it will be great, because this is our nation. Great Ukraine. Great recovery project. For the sake of the people. For the development of our country and the whole of Europe. I invite you to show to the world, to all present and future generations that war does not bring the result. And peace does. And it gives life. Sweden is the first country we offer this project to. You can take patronage over any city, region or industry to restore them. I am confident that your leadership will be indispensable. Your technology, business and your love of life. Your ability to organize space in people's best interest. Ukraine - all our heroic defenders, all our citizens - has already done a lot to protect our common European values, our common European home. We are fighting not only for Ukraine, but also for the security of the European Union! And we have proved that we deserve to be a full member of the European Union. The decision is already being elaborated. It's time to adopt it! I believe that you will support us in this as well. Thank you, thank you Sweden! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear attendees! I am addressing you from Kyiv, our capital, which has been fighting for a month already, just as our entire state. Yes, it is true - we are not in the Alliance. Not in the most powerful defense union in the world. Not one of the 30 states under the umbrella of joint protection. Under the umbrella of Article 5. It feels like we are in the ""gray zone"". Between the West and Russia. But we defend all our common values. And we are bright people! And we have been defending all these values for a month now! A month of heroic resistance. A month of the darkest suffering. A month of unpunished destruction of the peaceful state, and with it - the whole architecture of global security. All this is before the eyes of the whole world. Over the decades, Russia has accumulated considerable resources, military resources, manpower and equipment, air bombs, missiles. They invested crazy money in death while the world invested in life. But Ukraine is holding on bravely! At the cost of thousands of lives. At the cost of destroyed cities. At the cost of almost ten million migrants. Three and a half of them are already in your territories, in the territories of NATO countries. I am grateful for the support of these people. And people, unfortunately, continue to leave their homes. They are fleeing the terror that the occupiers brought with them. The very first hours of the invasion meant brutal missile strikes for us. During the month of the war, Russia fired more than a thousand different missiles at our cities. Made hundreds of air raids. On February 24, I addressed you with a perfectly clear, logical request to help close our skies. In any format. Protect our people from Russian bombs and missiles. We did not hear a clear answer. Ukraine does not have powerful anti-missile weapons, and has a much smaller aircraft fleet than Russia. Therefore, their advantage in the sky is like the use of weapons of mass destruction. And you see the consequences today - how many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed. The Ukrainian army has been resisting for a month in unequal conditions! And I have been repeating the same thing for a month now. To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance - without restrictions. As Russia uses without restrictions its entire arsenal against us. Destroys all living things. Any objects - from houses to churches, from food warehouses to universities, from bridges to hospitals. Ukraine asked for your planes. So that we do not lose so many people. And you have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven't been given any yet. We asked for tanks. So that we can unblock our cities that are now dying - Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol, others. Cities where Russia is keeping hundreds of thousands of people hostage and artificially creating famine - no water, no food, nothing there. You have at least 20,000 tanks! Ukraine asked for a percent, one percent of all your tanks to be given or sold to us! But we do not have a clear answer yet... The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help. Ukraine never wanted this war. And does not want to fight for years. We just want to save our people. We want to survive! Just survive! Like any nation, we have the right to it. The right to life. The right to this one percent. And I do not blame NATO - I want to be clear. You are not guilty. It's not your missiles, it's not your bombs that are destroying our cities. This morning, by the way, there were phosphorus bombs. Phosphorus Russian bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again. I just want you to know that the Alliance can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation, by providing us with all the weapons we need. Yes, we are not in the Alliance. And I do not make these claims. But Ukrainians never thought that the Alliance and the Allies were different. That in matters of life and death you can be a force separately, but together - no. That NATO may be afraid of Russia's actions. I am sure you already understand that Russia does not intend to stop in Ukraine. Does not intend and will not. It wants to go further. Against the eastern members of NATO. The Baltic states, Poland - that's for sure. Will NATO then stop thinking about it, worrying about how Russia will react? Who can be sure of that? And do you have confidence that Article 5 can work? ""Budapest"" hasn’t worked for us already. Our Budapest Memorandum. Has not worked for peace in Ukraine. And I will tell you honestly - today Budapest is not working for peace in Ukraine as well. Yes, we receive help from individual members of the Alliance. I am very grateful. Ukrainians are sincerely grateful for this. To each of you who gives what you have, supporting us. But what about the Alliance? The question of Article 5 is fundamental. I just want you to know what we think about it. And I sincerely wish you that we are wrong in our assessments and in our doubts. I sincerely wish that you actually have a very strong Alliance. Because if we are wrong, the world is safe. But if we are at least one percent right, I ask you to reconsider your attitude. Your own estimates. And really take care of security, security in Europe and, consequently, in the world. You can give us one percent of all your aircraft. One percent of all your tanks. One percent! We can't just buy it. Such a supply directly depends only on NATO's decisions, on political decisions, by the way. MLRS systems. Anti-ship weapons. Means of air defense. Is it possible to survive such a war without it? So when it's finally available, it will give us and you as well, one hundred percent security. And we need one. And the only thing I demand from you… After such a month of war. This is a request for the sake of our military. After such a war against Russia ... Never, please, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards. We have shown what our standards are capable of. And how much we can give to the common security in Europe and the world. How much we can do to protect against aggression against everything we value, everything you value. But NATO has yet to show what the Alliance can do to save people. To show that this is truly the most powerful defense union in the world. And the world is waiting. And Ukraine is very much waiting. Waiting for real actions. Real security guarantees. From those whose word is trustworthy. And whose actions can keep the peace. Truly. All offers are on the table. Our needs are on the table. We need peace immediately. The answers are up to you. I am thankful to those who help us! Thank you! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Free people of the free world! Ukrainians and citizens of all countries who value freedom! Friends! On March 24 it will be the month of our resistance. Heroic resistance of the Ukrainian state, the Ukrainian people to the ruthless invasion of Russia. It's already a month of our defense against the attempt to destroy us. Wipe off the face of the earth. The original plan of the Russian troops failed already in the first days of the invasion. They thought Ukrainians would be frightened. They thought Ukrainians would not fight. They were wrong. They know nothing about us, about Ukrainians. They know nothing at all about freedom. About how valuable it is. They do not know how freedom enriches life. Gives meaning to life. But there are many of them! There are still many invaders. Russia is getting manpower from everywhere. Equipment. Air bombs, missiles. Looking for mercenaries around the world. Any scum capable of shooting at civilians. Russian troops destroy our cities. Kill civilians indiscriminately. Rape women. Abduct children. Shoot at refugees. Capture humanitarian convoys. They are engaged in looting. They burn museums, blow up schools and hospitals. The target for them is universities, residential neighborhoods... Anything! Russian troops do not know the limits of evil. But... The war of Russia is not only the war against Ukraine. Its meaning is much wider.  Russia started the war against freedom as it is.  This is only the beginning for Russia on the Ukrainian land. Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe. Of all the people in the world. It tries to show that only crude and cruel force matters.  It tries to show that people do not matter, as well as everything else that makes us people.  That’s the reason we all must stop Russia. The world must stop the war.  I thank everyone who acts in support of Ukraine. In support of freedom. But the war continues. The acts of terror against peaceful people go on. One month already! That long! It breaks my heart, hearts of all Ukrainians and every free person on the planet.  That’s why I ask you to stand against the war! Starting from March 24 – exactly one month after the Russian invasion… From this day and after then.  Show your standing! Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities. Come in the name of peace. Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.  Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard. Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters.  From March 24.  In downtowns of your cities. All as one together who want to stop the war. I want to address the citizens of Russia separately. I am sure that there are many of you who are disgusted by the policy of your state. Who are already just sick of what you see on TV. Of the lies of your propagandists on the Internet. Propagandists who are paid by your taxes. And they lie about the war, which is paid for by your taxes. And which makes all the citizens of Russia poorer. Poorer every day. Isn't that stupid? Your state collects taxes from you to make you poorer. To isolate you from the world. To make it easier for them to control you. And easier to send you to the war to die. Ukraine has never threatened the security of Russia. Even now, we are doing everything just to bring peace back to our land. Not to yours - to our land. To our people. We are doing everything to end this war. And when we succeed - it will certainly happen - you will be sure of at least one thing: your children will no longer be sent to die on our land, on our territory. Therefore, you, the citizens of Russia, are also interested in peace. Save your sons from the war. Tell the truth about the war. And if you can leave Russia so as not to give your taxes to the war, do it. All polls show that the people of Europe and America support us. I am grateful to all of you for that. Grateful on behalf of Ukraine. To everyone in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Britain and other countries for supporting us. For supporting freedom. For supporting Ukraine. On March 24, three important summits will take place in Brussels, Europe. Important for the security of each of us. NATO Summit. EU Summit. G7 Summit. I'm sure people will show how they support us. But politicians must also support freedom. All of them. They must support the struggle for life. We are waiting for meaningful steps. From NATO, the EU and the G7. We know that the Russians have already begun to lobby their interests. These are the interests of war. We know that they are working with some partners. We know that they want to put this issue out. The struggle against war. But this is the war that needs to be put out.  Our firm position will be represented at these three summits. At these three summits we will see: Who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money. Life can be defended only when united. Freedom must be armed. Ukrainian sky has not been made safe from Russian missiles and bombs. We have not received aircraft and modern anti-missile weapons. We have not received tanks, anti-ship equipment. Russian forces can keep killing thousands of our citizens, destroying our cities. Just because there are too many invaders. Just because Russia has been preparing for such a war for decades. We asked to close our sky. And we asked for assistance from NATO to be effective and without limits. Any support in weapons that we need. We asked the Alliance to say it will fully help Ukraine win this war, clear our territories of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine.  Free people of the free world!  Together we must prevent Russia from breaking someone in NATO, EU or G7. From breaking and taking it to the war side. We will see on March 24. Ukrainians! All our heroes! A month has passed. We withstood six times longer than the enemy had planned, than the Russian command had reported to the Russian president. They were convinced that Ukraine is not a state. They were convinced that Ukrainians are not a nation. They deceived themselves. But we don't care about them. This is their state suicide. And we are just protecting our lives. Our freedom. Our own state. Our children. Hence, our future. This is a war for independence. And we must win. We will rebuild every city that heroically resists. We will bring the invaders to justice for every crime. Zhytomyr and Sumy, Kyiv and Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, Volnovakha and Mykolaiv, Okhtyrka and Hostomel, Kherson and Odesa, Izyum and Donetsk, Luhansk and Chornobaivka... All our people will live! In a free Ukraine. After our victory. Which will come sooner, the more we will all be united. We are all Ukrainians. We are all Europeans. We are all free people of the free world. In unity! On the battlefield and in political positions, at rallies and summits, at work and in communication with people. By all our actions, we must force Russia to seek peace. By all our actions, we must bring the victory of freedom closer. May the memory of all who died for Ukraine live forever! Eternal glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and gentlemen senators! Ladies and gentlemen deputies! Councillors of Paris! French people! Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today. I am sure that you are well aware of what is happening in Ukraine. You know why this is happening. And you know who is to blame. Even those who hide their heads in the sand know. And whose hands are still trying to get money from Russia. So today I am addressing you. Honest, brave, rational and freedom-loving. I am addressing you with questions: how to stop the war? How to return peace to our state? Because most of the puzzles that make up the answer are in your hands. On March 9, Russian bombs were dropped on a children's hospital and a maternity hospital in our city of Mariupol. It was a peaceful city in the south of Ukraine. Absolutely peaceful - until Russian troops approached and besieged it, as in the Middle Ages. Until they began to torture people with famine, thirst, kill with fire. There were people in the maternity hospital on which the Russians dropped bombs. There were women in labor. Most of them were saved. Some were seriously injured. One woman had to have her foot amputated, as it was completely shattered. And another woman... She had a shattered pelvis. Her child died before birth. Doctors tried to save the woman. Fought for her life! But she begged the doctors for her death. She begged to leave her, not to help her. Because she didn't know what to live for. They fought. She died. In Ukraine. In Europe. In 2022. When hundreds of millions of people could not even think that it could be so, that the world could be so ruined. I ask you now to honor the memory of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, all those who were killed as a result of Russia's invasion of the territory of our peaceful Ukraine with a moment of silence. After weeks of Russian invasion, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities hit by the occupiers resemble the ruins of Verdun. As in the photos of the First World War, which, I'm sure, each and every one of you saw. The Russian militaries do not care which targets to hit. They destroy everything: residential neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, universities. Warehouses with food and medicine are being burned. They burn everything. They do not take into account concepts such as ""war crime"" and ""binding conventions"". They brought terror to Ukraine, state terror. Each and every one of you is aware of this. All information is available. All the facts are there. About women raped by the Russian military in the temporarily occupied areas. About refugees shot on the roads. About journalists they kill knowing for sure that they are journalists. About old people who survived the Holocaust and are now forced to save themselves from Russian attacks on peaceful cities in bomb shelters. For 80 years, Europe has not seen the things that are happening in Ukraine now. Because of Russia's actions. When there are people so desperate that they beg for death! Like this woman. In 2019, when I became President, there was already a format for negotiations with Russia. It was the Normandy format. The format of negotiations that were to end the war in Donbas. The war in eastern Ukraine, which has been going on for 8 years, unfortunately. Four countries took part in the Normandy format - Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. Four, but through them the whole world, all positions were represented. Someone supported. Someone was trying to delay the process. Someone wanted to ruin everything. But it seemed important that the world was always present at that Normandy table, the table of peace. And when the negotiations yielded the result, when we managed to free people from captivity, when we were able to agree on some decisions in December 2019, it was like a breath of fresh air. Like a glimmer of hope. Hope that talks with Russia can help. That the Russian leadership can be convinced in words so that Moscow chooses peace. But February 24 came. A day that ruined all those efforts. All of us. Ruined the old meaning of the word ""dialogue"". Ruined the European experience of relations with Russia. Ruined decades of European history. All this was bombed by Russian troops. Destroyed by Russian artillery. Burned after Russian missile strikes. The truth was not found in the offices. So now we have to look for it and gain it on the battlefield. So what now? What do we have left? Our values. Unity. And the determination to defend our freedom. Common freedom! One for Paris and Kyiv. For Berlin and Warsaw. For Madrid and Rome. For Brussels and Bratislava. Sips of fresh air will definitely not help anymore. It makes sense to act together. To put pressure together. To force Russia to seek peace. Ladies and Gentlemen! French people! On February 24, the Ukrainian people united. Today we have no right or left. We do not look at who is in power and who is in opposition. The usual policy ended on the day of Russia's invasion and will resume only when there is peace. And this is right - to fight for life. To protect our state. We are grateful to you, we are grateful that France helps. We are grateful for the efforts of President Macron. Who showed true leadership. We are constantly communicating with him, it is true, we are coordinating some of our steps. Ukrainians see that France values freedom as much as it has always been. And you protect it. You remember what it is. Freedom, equality, brotherhood. Each of these words is full of power for you! I feel it. Ukrainians feel it. That is why we expect from you, we expect from France, from your leadership, that you will be able to make Russia seek peace. To make it end this war against freedom. Against equality. Against brotherhood. Against everything that made Europe united and full of free diverse life. We expect from France, from your leadership, that Ukraine's territorial integrity will be restored. And together we can do it. If among the attendees there are those who doubt it, your people are already sure. Like other nations of Europe. And that during France's presidency in the European Union the long overdue historical decision will be made - on Ukraine's full membership in Europe and the EU. Historical decision in historical time. As has always been the case in the history of the French people. Ladies and Gentlemen! French people! Tomorrow will be a month since Ukrainians have been fighting for their own lives, for their own freedom, since our army has been heroically opposing the overwhelming forces of Russia. We need more help! We need more support! In order for freedom not to lose, it must be well-armed. Tanks and anti-tank weapons, aviation and air defense. We need all this! You can help us. I know. You can! In order for freedom not to lose, the world must support it with sanctions against the aggressor. A new sanctions package every week. Every week! French companies must leave the Russian market. Renault, Auchan, Leroy Merlin and others. They must cease to be sponsors of Russia's military machine, sponsors of the killing of children and women, sponsors of rape, robbery and looting by the Russian army. All companies must remember once and for all that values are worth more than profit. Especially profit on blood. And we must already think about the future. About how we will live after this war. Guarantees are needed. Strong guarantees. Guarantees that security will be unshakable, that there will be no war, and that war in general will be impossible. We are creating such a system of guarantees. A new security system. In which France, I believe, will play a leading role. So that no one will ever have to beg for death again! So that people live their life. Full life. And so that we say goodbye to people not under bombs, not in war, but when the time comes. Only in peace. Only in dignity. Because you have to live so that you are respected. So that you are remembered. And so that people say goodbye to you in a way France said goodbye to the great Belmondo. Thank you, France! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Distinguished Members of the Japanese Parliament! Dear Japanese people! It is a great honor for me, the President of Ukraine, to address you for the first time in the history of the Japanese Parliament. Our capitals are separated by a distance of 8 thousand 193 kilometers. On average, it's 15 hours on a plane. Depending on the route. But what is the distance between our feelings of freedom? Between our desires to live? Between our aspirations for peace? On February 24, I did not see any distance. Even a millimeter between our capitals. Even a second between our feelings. Because you immediately came to our aid. And I'm grateful to you for that. When Russia destroyed peace for the entire Ukraine, we immediately saw that the world is truly against the war. Truly for freedom. Truly for global security. Truly for the harmonious development of every society. Japan has become the leader of this position in Asia. You immediately started working to stop this brutal war started by the Russian Federation. You immediately started working for peace in Ukraine. Hence, in Europe. And this is really very important. It is important for everyone on Earth. Because without peace for Ukraine, no person in the world will be able to look to the future with confidence. Each of you knows what Chornobyl is. Nuclear power plant in Ukraine, where a powerful explosion occurred in 1986. Radiation release. The consequences of which have been recorded in different parts of the planet. The 30-kilometer zone around the Chornobyl station is still closed. It is hazardous. During the elimination of the consequences of the explosion at the station, thousands of tons of contaminated materials, debris and cars were disposed of in the forests in the closed area. Just in the ground. On February 24, Russian armored vehicles passed through this land. Lifting radioactive dust into the air. The Chornobyl station was captured. By force, by weapon. Imagine a nuclear power plant where a disaster happened. Confinement that closes the destroyed reactor. Operating nuclear waste storage facility. Russia has turned this facility into an arena of war as well. And Russia is using this 30-kilometer territory, this closed zone, to prepare new attacks against our defense forces. It will take years after Russian troops leave Ukraine to investigate the damage they have done to Chornobyl. What sites of radioactive materials disposal were damaged. And how radioactive dust spread on the planet. Ladies and Gentlemen! There are four operating nuclear power plants on our land! These are 15 nuclear units. And they are all under threat. Russian troops have already fired from tanks at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. The fighting has damaged hundreds of plants, many of them particularly dangerous. The shelling threatens gas and oil pipelines. Coal mines. The other day, Russian troops also fired at a chemical plant in the Sumy region of Ukraine. There was a leak of ammonia. We are warned about possible chemical attacks, in particular with the use of sarin. As it was in Syria. And one of the main topics for discussion of world politicians is the question: how to react if Russia also uses nuclear weapons. Any confidence of any person in the world, any country is completely destroyed. Our servicemen have been heroically defending Ukraine for 28 days already. 28 days of full-scale invasion of the largest state in the world. But not the greatest in potential. Not the most influential. And the smallest from a moral point of view. Russia has used more than a thousand missiles against peaceful cities in Ukraine. Countless bombs. Russian troops destroyed dozens of our cities. Some were burned to the ground. In many towns and villages that have come under Russian occupation, our people cannot even bury their murdered relatives, friends and neighbors with dignity. They have to bury them right in the yards of broken houses, near roads, anywhere where it is possible... Thousands were killed, including 121 children. About 9 million Ukrainians were forced to leave their home, their native places, fleeing from Russian troops. Our northern territories, eastern, southern are becoming empty, because people are fleeing from this deadly threat. Russia has even blocked the sea for us. Usual trade routes. Showing some other - potential - aggressors of the world how to put pressure on free nations by blocking sea navigation. Ladies and Gentlemen! Today, it is Ukraine, the partner states and our anti-war coalition that can guarantee that world security will not be completely destroyed. That in the world there will be a foothold for the freedom of nations. For people and for the preservation of diversity in societies. For security of borders. To make sure that we, our children, our grandchildren still have peace. You see that international institutions have not worked. Even the UN and the Security Council... What can they do? They need reform. They need an injection of honesty. To become effective. To really decide and really influence, not just discuss. Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, the world is destabilized. The world is on the verge of many new crises. And who is now sure what tomorrow will be like? Turbulence in world markets is a problem for all countries that depend on imports of raw materials. Environmental and food challenges are unprecedented. And most importantly, it is now being decided whether all the aggressors on the planet - explicit and potential - will be convinced that the war they have waged will lead to a punishment so powerful that they should not start a war. That they should not destroy the world. And it is absolutely logical and correct that the responsible states unite to protect peace. I am grateful to your state for its principled position at such a historic moment. For real help to Ukraine. You were the first in Asia to put real pressure on Russia to restore peace. Who supported the sanctions against Russia. And I urge you to continue to do so. I call for the united efforts of the Asian countries, your partners, to stabilize the situation. So that Russia seeks peace. And stops the tsunami of its brutal invasion of our state, Ukraine. It is necessary to impose an embargo on trade with Russia. It is necessary to withdraw companies from the Russian market so that the money does not go to the Russian army. It is necessary to help our state, our defenders, our soldiers who are holding back Russian troops even more. It is necessary to start thinking about rebuilding Ukraine already now. About the return of life to the cities destroyed by Russia and the territories devastated by it. People need to go back to where they lived. Where they grew up. Where they feel is their home. Their small homeland. I'm sure you understand this feeling. This need. The need to return to your land. We need to develop new security guarantees. So that it is possible to act preventively and strongly every time there is a threat to peace. Is it possible to do this on the basis of existing international structures? After such a war - definitely not. We need to create new tools. New guarantees. Which will work preventively and strongly against any aggression. Which will really help. Japan's leadership can be indispensable in their development. For Ukraine, for the world. I offer it to you. So that the world can feel confident again. Confident about what tomorrow will be like. Confident that tomorrow will come and will be stable and peaceful. For us, for future generations. Ladies and Gentlemen! Japanese people! We can do a lot together with you. Even more than we can imagine. I know what a brilliant history of development you have. How you can build and defend harmony. Follow the principles and value life. Protect the environment. The roots of this are in your culture. Which Ukrainians really love. My words are not unsubstantiated. This is actually true. Back in 2019, literally six months after I became President of Ukraine, my wife Olena took part in a project for children with visual impairments. In the project to create audiobooks. And she voiced Japanese fairy tales. In Ukrainian. Because they are understandable for us, for children. And it was only a drop in the huge sea of our attention, the Ukrainian attention, to your attainment. We have similar values with you despite the huge distance between our countries. A distance that doesn't really exist. Because we have equally warm hearts. Thanks to joint efforts, thanks to even greater pressure on Russia, we will come to peace. And we will be able to rebuild our country. Reform international institutions.  I am sure that Japan will be with us then - just as it is now. In our anti-war coalition. At this crucial time for all of us. Thank you! Arigato gozaimasu! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Japan!

0,"Free people of a free country! Today was one of those days that allows us to say with confidence that the whole world is with us. In the morning I spoke with His Holiness Pope Francis about the search for peace for Ukraine, for our state, about the atrocities of the occupiers, about the humanitarian corridors to the besieged cities. I thanked His Holiness for a clear and strong position against the war and for his prayers for Ukraine. I invited him to visit our country at this crucial time. I believe that we will be able to organize this important visit, which will unequivocally support each of us, each of the Ukrainians. I addressed both chambers of the Italian parliament today. I felt maximum support. Sincere warmth in words. I called on Italy to strengthen sanctions against Russia and its regime. And strike hard at all Russian figures responsible for this war. For the war against us. Strike at their real estate, accounts and yachts. Strike at their habit to earn money by war and to live and have a rest far away, in Europe, where it is peaceful and cozy. I am sure that new sanctions will be introduced this week. And I am grateful to Italy for supporting Ukraine's membership in the EU. I spoke with President of Slovakia Zuzana Čaputová. About our cooperation and our security. About the development of Ukraine - with all together, in the European Union. An important conversation also took place with the Prime Minister of Canada. We continue to coordinate our positions on the eve of this week's NATO and G7 summits. Justin Trudeau will support us. A special aspect is security guarantees for Ukraine. They are vital not only for us, but also for all neighboring countries. Because of our security, which will cement peace in Eastern Europe. I am grateful to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece who was the first European official to decide to support the work of our humanitarian corridors in Mariupol. To evacuate our people from the city and bring in humanitarian aid, which is crucially important for everyone. As of today, there are about a hundred thousand people in the city. In inhumane conditions. In a complete blockade. No food, no water, no medicine. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing. For more than a week now we have been trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents. And almost all our attempts, unfortunately, are disrupted by the Russian occupiers. By shelling or deliberate terror. Today, one of the humanitarian columns was simply captured by the occupiers. On the agreed route near Manhush. SES employees and bus drivers were taken prisoner. We are doing everything we can to free our people and unblock the movement of humanitarian aid. That is why I am grateful when a high-level representative of a European state agrees to personally join the humanitarian mission. We expect the implementation of this plan by the Greek Foreign Minister in the coming days. Despite all the difficulties, 7,026 Mariupol residents were rescued today. Tomorrow we will continue this important work. Our representatives are trying to agree on humanitarian corridors in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk regions. Another important news is that an online tool has been created for everyone who can and wants to help with humanitarian goods for Ukraine. In the last two weeks alone, our country has received more than 100,000 tons of humanitarian aid. These cargoes are quickly distributed through special hubs for the regions. But there are even more appeals. Even more opportunities. Even more work. Therefore, to simplify the process as much as possible, the website help.gov.ua was created. On the website you can learn how to buy, how to send and whom to address humanitarian aid. This is for everyone who wants to join. For anyone who can help. In Ukraine and in the world. So that the aid is sent constantly, 24/7. Our Armed Forces pleased us today. Chornobaivka again - the defeat of the occupiers again. Russian planes were shot down again. Especially important - the bomber was shot down over Mariupol. And so it will be with everyone who kills our people, peaceful people on our peaceful land. I want to repeat once again to all Russian pilots who do not think about the order they fulfill. Killing civilians is a crime. And you will be responsible anyway. Today or tomorrow - this is less important. The main thing is that it is inevitable. We continue to work at various levels to force Russia to peace. To the end of this brutal war. Ukrainian representatives are working on the negotiations, which continue virtually every day. It's very difficult. Sometimes scandalous. But step by step we are moving forward. I am also grateful to all the international mediators who are fighting for Ukraine, for Europe, for the truth. Who bring to Moscow the real picture. Honest. And encourage to look realistically. At what happens in battles. And at the fact that the world will not stop defending the truth. Our truth. Three important summits this week: the G7, NATO and the EU. New sanctions packages, new aid. We will work, we will fight in any way we can. Till the end. Bravely and openly. At all these sites. With full energy. For the result. With all our strength. And we will not get tired. Let's rest when we win. And it definitely will happen. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"The hardest part of any speech is the beginning. You all probably know that. In other circumstances, I would have spent a lot of time on it. On the right, most appropriate beginning. But I don't have time. So I'll start with the simple. We have been told for years that Ukraine is not reforming properly. But let's look at the results. The modernized Armed Forces have been holding back the aggression of one of the world's most powerful armies for almost a month already. Logistics chains are functioning. The courts are working. Trains run and transport millions of people. Utilities are doing their job even under shelling and bombing. The test of war is perhaps the most severe. We are successfully reforming even now. And our sustainability turned out to be absolutely real. But sustainability is not an absolute category. It's not about availability, it's about measure. How much is left? Depends on many factors: We now enjoy serious support. The West has finally become collective. This is evidenced by sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine - humanitarian, economic, political, military and technical. But is that enough? And for how long will the West keep it? For how long are those states that have sought to maintain economic ties with Russia at all costs, even in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine willing to suffer losses from disruption of these ties? Given the experience of the previous eight years, we cannot be too optimistic here. However, now the risks for the whole world have grown so much that they will simply not be allowed to do business as usual. The next factor is the factor of Russia itself. What is its margin of safety? What are its goals? The West is constantly talking about increasing the price that Russia will have to pay for aggression. But can we imagine the limit beyond which the Russian leadership will say: it is too expensive? It should be understood that the narrative of ""victory at any cost"" is not just a propaganda cliche. Moscow has repeatedly instrumentalized it, beating the stake of those it considered enemies. In the number of victims. In the violation of international law. In resorting to blackmail, including threats of man-made disasters and unconventional weapons. In everything. This must be understood. At the same time, it should be understood that ""small victorious wars"" that do not achieve their goal always increase Russia's risk of a social explosion and coup. Success in war, on the other hand, stabilizes and preserves the regime. Nourishes its desire for further conquests. You may ask, what is the conclusion? And the conclusion is that Ukraine must win the war that Russia has started against us. We must work only for such a result. All of us. What is happening in Ukraine now concerns everyone. Everyone in this room. Every government. Everyone in the world. The war in Ukraine is not just another local conflict. This is a world war that is so far going on in our country. I would like to emphasize once again that Russia's encroachments go far beyond Ukraine. It claims to restore the Soviet sphere of influence in both Europe and Asia. It claims to break the entire system of international relations and discredit all security institutions. Therefore, Kazakhstan, Poland, the Baltic States, Slovakia, Moldova, and Georgia may be next… Yes, Moldova and Georgia again. Georgia, which after Saakashvili is again afraid to say the wrong word to Moscow. Well, apparently, this is such a non-trivial course of Tbilisi's European integration. On the Russian military equipment they write ""To Berlin!"" once again. Do you know what that means? We know. The Israelis know. Believe those who promise to kill you. In the case of Ukraine, the goal of Russia is one - to destroy. To deprive of agency. To stop nation building. According to the program thesis about one nation, which we have been hearing for two decades. Therefore, one may say that this war has no rational basis. It is a war of will, not of necessity. But this is probably the first historiosophical war in history. Therefore, we must assume that the current leadership of Russia will not abandon this goal. And it is ready to pay. The question of whether its entourage is willing to pay can now be omitted. So let's focus on this - the intention to destroy Ukraine. This was not achieved by rapid operation. None of the strategic tasks of the invading force were fulfilled. Therefore, the aggressor is trying to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe, destroy critical civilian infrastructure and industrial potential. We must take into account that the war is taking place on our territory. That our people are dying, that our cities are being destroyed. Our Armed Forces and citizens are holding on with superhuman courage, but we cannot win the war without offensive weapons, without medium-range missiles that can be a means of deterrence (I emphasize: in our case - deterrence, not aggression) threatening Russian territory with comparative destruction. Without a full Lend-Lease, we can only defend ourselves. But it is impossible to defend effectively for a long time without a reliable echelon of air defense systems that shoot down enemy ballistic missiles at a long distance. However, we are not given it. Just as we are not given fighter jets. Just as we are not welcome in NATO. This fear of escalation is understandable. But this fear will not save you. Winston Churchill explained everything: he who chooses shame between shame and war, gets both shame and war. I once produced ""Forebodings"" movie directed by the talented Vyacheslav Kristofovich. So, the protagonist has such a remarkable phrase: ""Everything must happen on time."" Today I feel the power of this phrase more than ever. Everything must happen on time. Now it is high time. An extraordinary meeting of the Allies is scheduled to take place in Brussels this Thursday, March 24. There is still time to take concrete steps towards Ukraine. Or to say honestly and publicly that there will be no such steps. That NATO is refusing to allow Ukraine to join, not Ukraine is refusing to join, as many have been trying to pretend lately. To say - and together start building a new security system. The Russian leadership understands only the language of power and always confuses peacefulness with weakness. I want to ask our European partners: what are you really like? Are you peaceful or weak? Will you finally give us the weapons that will allow Ukraine to remain an independent sovereign state within internationally recognized borders? Will you finally launch a full-fledged Lend-Lease for us? Or will you continue to watch with concern as our cities turn into ruins? I'll just say simply: close our skies or at least give us long-range air defense systems. Your fear of escalation nurtures aggression. Your determination holds it back. Clearly articulated position ""We will shoot down planes that are instruments of terror. We will destroy the Russian air defense systems that will attack our air police,” is what we need. Tomorrow. Now. Yesterday. Otherwise, Ukraine will bleed out. Become depopulated. We will not surrender, it is already clear to everyone. But let me remind you what I said at the beginning: sustainability is not about availability, but about measure. After the Russian occupation of Crimea and the invasion of Donbas, foreign experts began to talk about the ""Finlandization"" of Ukraine. They meant only one thing: neutral status and ""special"" relations with Russia. But for some reason none of them said that ""Finlandization"" is the preservation of the state, its agency and the freedom of the people at the cost of the forced loss of certain territories as a result of aggression. But we will not give up our sovereignty or territorial integrity. And when we return our territories at the cost of incredible efforts and sacrifices, it will be our victory, but not Russia's defeat. Because without decisive actions of the world community, nothing will prevent the aggressor from continuing to strike at any place of our state. And every such blow to Ukraine will be a blow to international law. The intensification of the refugee crisis in the EU. The collapse of the world security system and the institutions that guarantee it. After all, it is a blow to global food security. In fact, all this is a key sign of a world order crisis. An order where the readiness of the international community to punish acts of aggression, punish genocide remains largely declarative. Profit over justice - was that why the UN was created? Has Europe united around this? If so, none of the existing security systems is suitable for Ukraine. We need a new one. Fair. This system will have to be built from scratch. We are ready. And we paid for it. Paid the highest price - pain, sweat, blood, lives. This fee gives us the moral right to demand: act! Right now! To put it simply, the ""Finlandization"" of Ukraine or any other model of neutralization on Russian terms, which does not involve building a new security system, will only guarantee that these challenges and threats will last forever. So I will ask: European countries, where will your refugees flee to? Ukraine remains Europe's only shield. But what happens if this shield is critically damaged? The half-hearted position of the world community, unfortunately, makes this scenario possible. In this case, reliable guarantees of our security become fundamentally important for us. Multilateral legally binding guarantees. But is there anything as reliable in the West as the NATO umbrella? Sorry, we are not aware of that. And the world needs the same credible assurances that Russia will no longer be able to successfully pursue its military ambitions in the international arena. We demand such guarantees from our partners. Citizens of other states, demand such guarantees from your government officials. Demand now, because tomorrow will be late. Without such guarantees, any of our agreements will be fragile and temporary. And they will hold until the moment when Russia regains its strength and tries to attack again. The timing of this will depend directly on the pace of easing of sanctions pressure on Russia and its ability to circumvent restrictive measures. We therefore call for steady and unwavering strengthening of these sanctions. International businesses should not think about how to bypass them for the sake of profits. They must not become an accomplice in crimes against humanity. Such complicity should not only be a burden on the conscience. We call on foreign governments to prosecute such collaborations. Up to the criminal liability. President Zelenskyy said this very clearly: ""Do not sponsor Russia's military machine. No euro for the occupiers. Close all your ports to them, do not supply goods, give up Russian energy resources, force Russia to leave Ukraine. I believe that peace is possible, but you must act to come to peace."" Governments are hesitant. But ordinary people have already made a choice. They are convinced that Ukraine has a place in the EU. This is the average opinion of 71% of respondents. 79% of Europeans believe that sanctions against Russia are the right thing to do. 67% of EU citizens believe that Ukraine needs to be provided with weapons. These are the results of a poll published by the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP). These figures are more than eloquent. So I will tell governments to finally listen to your voters. We call on the international community - not only the collective West, but also China and India - to put aside discord among themselves. The war in Ukraine affects all of you. You are the leaders of this world. Someone will talk about the two poles. I'm talking about two parts of the whole. The Russian issue should not prevent you from reaching an agreement. The interpenetration of economies and integration is a much more powerful guarantee of global peace than the threat of mutual destruction. You can reach an agreement. Russia's aggression against Ukraine may seem to some a good opportunity to fulfill their own ambitions. However, in reality this is a false impression: hopes that the war will be ""localized"" in Ukraine are in vain. Without proper rebuff, Moscow will not stop, and each of its subsequent ventures will inevitably bring the world closer to the hot global conflict. The dramatic events in Ukraine, the heroic struggle of our country for freedom and democracy have shown the whole world: our east and west are together. Now we call on the world to become a little bit like Ukraine. East and West, stand together to protect the planet from those who seek to replace the force of law with the law of force.

0,"Dear speakers! Dear ladies and gentlemen, senators and deputies! Dear Italian people! This morning I spoke with His Holiness Pope Francis and he said very important words: “I understand that you want peace. I understand that you have to protect yourself. Both the servicemen and civilians courageously defend the homeland. Everyone is defending the homeland."" And I replied: ""Our people have become this army."" They became this army when they saw the trouble the enemy was causing. The devastation it leaves behind. And the huge amount of blood it wants to shed. When I addressed a rally in Florence and dozens of other European cities a little over a week ago, I asked all Italians, all Europeans to remember the number 79. The number of children killed in Ukraine at that time. Now it's 117. 38 children more during these days. This is the price of the delay. Delay with pressure on Russia. So that it ends this brutal war. 117 children, thousands of adults. Thousands wounded. Tens of thousands of destroyed families. Hundreds of thousands of ruined destinies. Millions, already millions of abandoned homes. And it all started with one person. In the occupied areas, murdered families are buried right in the yards of high-rise buildings. In the parks. In mass graves. This is happening today. In 2022. And we know that every next day of the war will take the lives of our children. 117 is not a final number. The Russian invasion will destroy more families and destinies. Unfortunately, the full-scale war continues. Russian missiles, aircraft and artillery do not stop killing. Ukrainian cities are being ruined. Some are almost completely destroyed. Like Mariupol. You heard of it. Our city on the shore of the Sea of Azov. Where about half a million people lived. Just as in your city of Genoa. I was there. And now there is nothing in Mariupol. Only ruins. Imagine completely burned Genoa. After three weeks of total blockade. Bombing, shelling, which did not stop for a moment. Ruined Genoa, from which people are being evacuated, your wonderful people. On foot, by cars, by buses... Just to get to where it is safe. I am addressing you from Kyiv, our capital. From a city that is as important to our region as Rome is to the whole world. The origin of the great culture of a great nation is in Kyiv. And now we are on the verge of survival. Kyiv has gone through brutal wars throughout its history. And it deserves, after all the losses and tragedies, to live in peace. In eternal peace. As Rome and any other city in our world deserves. But, unfortunately, there is an air alarm in Kyiv every day. Bombs and rockets fall every day. Near Kyiv, in neighboring towns and districts, there are several groups of Russian troops. Those who kill and torture, rape and kidnap children, destroy and rob. The occupiers take our property to Russia by trucks. The last one who did something like this in Europe were the Nazis. When they invaded other countries. Russian troops have even mined the sea near our ports. And now it threatens neighboring shores and neighboring countries, because mines can drift by sea to them. Ladies and Gentlemen! Italian people! It’s time to do everything possible to ensure peace! This is a war that Russia has been preparing for a long time. Which one person has been preparing for a long time. One! For decades. Earning crazy money on oil and gas exports and directing them to prepare for war. And not only against Ukraine. Their goal is Europe. Decisive influence on your life, control over your policy, destruction of your values. Not only ours. Democracy, human rights, equality, freedom... The same values as ours. Ukraine is the gateway to Europe for Russian troops. They want to break in. But barbarism must not pass. Ukrainians were one of the first to come to your aid when you needed it during the COVID pandemic. We sent our doctors. Italians were among the first to come to our aid when our people were affected by the terrible floods. You supported us - sincerely, quickly. Without asking for anything in return. You are helping us now - we really appreciate it. But still... The invasion has not stopped in 27 days. Almost a month. So more sanctions are needed, even more pressure, so that Russia is looking not for military reserves or mercenaries somewhere in Libya or Syria, but for peace. So that the same one person is looking for peace. The consequences of this war are already felt in many parts of the world. Not only in Europe. And the worst thing will be famine. Approaching different countries. Ukraine has always been one of the largest exporters of food. But how can we sow under the blows of Russian artillery? How can we sow when the enemy deliberately mines the fields, destroys fuel bases? We do not know what harvest we will have and whether we’ll be able to export. When our ports are blocked and seized. Corn, vegetable oil, wheat and many other products. Vital goods. For your neighbors as well. Across the sea. Prices are already rising. So how many tens of millions of people will need help? In front of your shores... Ladies and Gentlemen! Italian people! You know Ukrainians well. Our people who never wanted to fight. Who are Europeans just like you. You know those who brought war to Ukraine. You know for sure. Those who order to fight. And those who promote it. Almost all of them use Italy. As a place for vacation. So don't be a resort for murderers. Block all their real estate, accounts and yachts - from ""Scheherazade"" to the smallest ones. Block the assets of all those who have influence in Russia. Let them apply their influence for peace. To be able to come back to you someday. Support greater sanctions against Russia. A complete embargo on trade, starting with oil. Support a ban on entering your ports for Russian ships. So that they feel the price for their aggression and for mining the sea. There should be no exceptions to the sanctions regime for any Russian bank. Do not allow the food crisis in your neighboring regions. Help us. Stop the killings. Save Ukrainian families. This war must end as soon as possible. Peace must be restored. Enemy troops must be withdrawn from Ukraine. Demining must be carried out. And reconstruction. Reconstruction of Ukraine after this war. Together with you, together with Italy. Together with Europe. Together - in the European Union. Before the war, I often visited your country. I appreciate your hospitality, sincerity and sometimes loudness. I saw what family and children mean to you. You have wonderful families, you have wonderful children. What life means to you. I want to thank you for helping the Ukrainians who found a shelter from this war in your country. Today, there are more than 70,000 of our people in Italy who, unfortunately, had to hide from the war. More than 25 thousand children. And many of them have received warmth in your Italian families. Including in the families present in this hall. The first Ukrainian was born in Italy, whose mother found refuge on your land. Dozens of Ukrainian children with severe shell shock and injuries are being treated by you. We are grateful to you for that, very grateful! And we are waiting for them to return home. To Ukraine - already peaceful. And you can definitely help us with that. From the first day of this war, you have shared our pain and are helping sincerely - from the heart. Ukrainians will always remember this. Your warmth, your care and your strength that must stop one person. Just one person for millions to survive. Glory to Ukraine! Grazie Italia!

0,"Free people of a free country! Our 26th day of full-scale war is over. After 8 years of aggression in the east of our state. The enemy is slowly trying to move. To go on the offensive somewhere. To capture our road somewhere. To cross the river somewhere. The Ukrainian army - well done - repels these attempts. And holds back the occupiers. Today, Russian troops hit the Zhytomyr region with Grads. They got a decent answer. Another enemy aircraft was shot down in the Kharkiv region near Chuhuiv. Our military has already shot down so many Russian planes and helicopters that one can only wonder: what do their pilots have instead of mind? Is it also emptiness? I said “also” not by accident, because they definitely have emptiness instead of heart. Instead of soul. Instead of everything that makes a human human. Borys Romanchenko, a former prisoner of Nazi concentration camps, was killed in Kharkiv. He was 96 years old. Think about it - he went through so much! He survived in Buchenwald, Dora-Mittelbau, Peenemünde and Bergen-Belsen - the death conveyors created by the Nazis. And he was killed by a Russian projectile that hit an ordinary Kharkiv high-rise building... Each passing day of this war makes it increasingly clear what their ""denazification"" is. In Kherson, the occupiers shot at people who peacefully took to the streets without weapons at a rally for their freedom. For our freedom. The Russian soldiers do not even know what it is like to be free. They were driven here, to be honest, as if sentenced. Sentenced to death, sentenced to disgrace. A column of civilians came under fire in the Zaporizhzhia region. There were many children. Four children were hospitalized. Two are in grave condition. During the day 8 humanitarian corridors worked. Kyiv, Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Vorzel, Bucha, Velyka Dymerka, Mariupol, Lysychansk, Severodonetsk, Popasna and Kreminna. 8 thousand 57 people were rescued. Thank you to everyone who did it, who worked for the people. We also managed to deliver 200 tons of humanitarian aid. I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Rutte and President of France Emanuel Macron. We are coordinating our positions on the eve of important summits in Europe. Meetings of the G7, leaders of NATO and the European Union will take place on March 24. Our position will definitely sound. It will sound, believe me, firmly. I signed a decree on awarding orders and medals to 105 of our warriors. I am grateful to each of them. 7 of them are, unfortunately, awarded posthumously. It was a day of difficult events. Difficult conclusions.

0,"Great people of great Ukraine! In this video, I want to appeal separately to the Ukrainian cities and the brave inhabitants of these cities. To the free south of Ukraine, where the sun shines only to welcome guests, not to random ""tourists"" on tanks. To Berdyansk, Kakhovka, Enerhodar, Melitopol and, of course, Kherson. To Kherson, where today we saw slaves shooting at free people. Slaves of propaganda that replaces their consciousness. Slaves who used to pack everyone in paddy wagons. Even an old woman with a clean white poster. Even a girl with an A4 sheet on which only one word is written - ""peace"". These slaves sent by Russia have never seen so many free people in the squares and streets. They have never seen thousands of people who are not afraid of them, of slaves with weapons in their hands. Slaves perceive freedom as savagery, as danger. They are scared. The fear that propagandists know how to turn into hatred. And then - shots at peaceful free people. Kherson, hold on! We will never forget these shots. Shots from your city. We were all with you in your square and streets. 40 million Ukrainians of our state. Millions and millions of Ukrainians in the world. We've all seen you stand. We’ve seen who you are. We have all felt how you want to regain your freedom. On land, where, watching the Milky Way, the Chumaks went for salt, the enemies felt terrible. And as soon as we can break through to you, every occupier who shot at peaceful Kherson residents just for the blue-yellow color will have a black stripe. And the same awaits the Russian military pale from the fright who were driven out today in Enerhodar. Peaceful Ukrainians drove them out with bare hands. The occupiers in Berdyansk, Melitopol and Kakhovka will have a black stripe. Wherever the occupiers kidnap our people. Those who they think are organizing the resistance. But we are not Russia. Remember. And there is no need to organize resistance here. Resistance for Ukrainians is a feature of the soul. And I really want you, all our Ukrainians in the south, to never think even for a moment that Ukraine does not remember you. Whenever you are in pain, when you resist in spite of everything, please know that our hearts are broken at this time, because we are not with you. And we ask God to support you until we can drive strangers out. This is a feat that you are protesting. This is happiness that we have such people. That we are all Ukraine. During this invasion, heroes have constantly declared themselves among millions of our people. Once - ordinary Ukrainians, and now - fighters. Men and women who stand up for our state. Everywhere: in the south, in the east, in the north, in the center, in the west and abroad. Stand up so that the enemy does not believe that this is a reality. But we will make them believe. And we will make them remember that they are not welcome. And they will never be. In Kyiv, which stands bravely and majestically above the Dnieper. In Kharkiv... Proud, tidy, educated Kharkiv. Which they beat, and it does not obey. Chernihiv. Ancient! Chernihiv, which since the time of the Horde has not faced such atrocities committed by the Russian military now. Sumy, Okhtyrka and Lebedyn... Izyum, Derhachi ... Volnovakha, Popasna... Borodyanka, Hostomel, Makariv... Mykolaiv... Mariupol! Hardworking and honest city! Mariupol. Which the occupiers are simply destroying. Destroying to ashes. But it will survive them all. Worthless slaves who do not know how to take care of their own country. Of their own people. And they go to someone else's. We are fighting for every Ukrainian! And we remember everyone! We are grateful to everyone. Both to the people and to these beautiful cities. As well as to Lviv, as well as to Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyi, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Lutsk, our Uzhhorod... Kropyvnytskyi, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih... Vinnytsia, Rivne... Cherkasy, Poltava... Odesa! Those who may be infrequently mentioned in speeches. But who care about our common future. About Ukraine. And about freedom - for each of us. Who shelter people who have been forced to leave their home. Who work for defense. Who send humanitarian goods. Who deploy the evacuated businesses. Who heal, who help. Help all of us, and therefore themselves. Great people of great Ukraine! And I say this not accidentally - great Ukraine. Because I appeal to everyone in our country and to those abroad. In cities and villages. Those who are free and who are temporarily under occupation. In Crimea, in Donetsk, in Luhansk. Where they must also fight for freedom, not sit and wait. I appeal to all Ukrainians. Wherever we are. Do everything to protect our state. To save our people. Fight. Fight and help. Drive these slaves out! Drive the occupiers out! So that Ukraine lives. So that all of us live with it. Free and peaceful. Which we love so much. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Free people of a free country! The 25th day has come to an end since the Russian military has gone to the exercise and found themselves on our land. They all say so when taken captive.  It is already the 25th day since the Russian military has been vainly trying to find imaginary “Nazis” from whom they allegedly wanted to defend our people. Just as they are vainly trying to find Ukrainians who would meet them with flowers. At least in one city of our state. At least in one village. And most importantly - the Russian military cannot find a way home. That is why our soldiers help them with the path to God's judgment. To God's judgment where I am sure they receive only one punishment, one for all: the eternal cellar. Forever under the bombs. Forever without food, water and heat. For everything they did to our people, ordinary Ukrainians. To peaceful people. In Okhtyrka and Kharkiv, in Borodyanka and Chernihiv. In Volnovakha and Mariupol. And many of our other courageous cities. In besieged Mariupol, Russian aircraft dropped a bomb on an art school. People were hiding there. Hiding from shelling, from bombing. There were no military positions. There were about four hundred civilians. Mostly women and children, the elderly. They are under the debris. We do not know how many are alive at the moment. But we know that we will definitely shoot down the pilot who dropped that bomb. As we already did to almost a hundred other similar mass murderers. Today, in the Knesset, I addressed all deputies and government officials. But first of all, I spoke on your behalf, on behalf of all Ukrainians with the people of Israel, who, I am sure, understand us. As free people understand free people. Of course, Israel has its own interests, a strategy to protect its citizens. We understand that. Israeli Prime Minister Bennett is trying to find a way to negotiate with Russia. And we are grateful for that. For every effort. So that sooner or later we start talking to Russia, perhaps in Jerusalem. This is the right place to find peace. If it is possible. Well, Russian propagandists today have a rather difficult task. After all, for the first time in history, the president of a foreign state spoke in the Knesset via video call. And spoke to the people of Israel. The President of Ukraine accused in Moscow of ""Nazism” spoke in the Knesset to the people of Israel. This fact alone confirms how wrong things are in Moscow. During the day on March 20, only 4 humanitarian corridors worked. A total of 7,295 people were evacuated. Almost 4,000 Mariupol residents arrived in Zaporizhzhia in one day. Tomorrow morning we are preparing to send new buses to Mariupol to continue this important mission. More than 3,000 people were rescued in the Kyiv region. But in the Kharkiv region... Russian troops captured our convoy, our humanitarian cargo for the city of Vovchansk. There is no connection now with six people. Five drivers and one doctor. We will release them. We will try again and again to deliver to our people what they need. The Kherson region fought again today. I am grateful to them. Again on the streets. And as always - for all of us, for Ukraine. With national flags. And with our Ukrainian courage. Unarmed against the occupiers. Against shots and military vehicles. This is a feat that inspires us all. This is Ukraine we are proud of. These are Ukrainians to whom I am immensely grateful. Just as all our people are. In the afternoon I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. A true friend of Ukraine who does not hesitate and does not seek excuses. We agreed on concrete support for our country at next week's G7 and NATO summits. Although we are not members of these organizations, I see that Ukraine has at least one vote there. I also spoke with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. A star couple who sincerely believe in us, in our victory, in our future. They help Ukrainian IDPs by raising funds. And the two of them have already raised $ 35 million. I thanked them on behalf of our people, on behalf of all of us. Agree, this is a good result for one couple of our friends in America. And we are working to make the whole world our friends. I personally presented state awards to Ukrainian intelligence officers. Please understand - I can't say their names publicly. But believe me, the contribution of these people to our defense is so significant that the orders and the title of Hero of Ukraine for them is the minimum we can give. Just to express gratitude. To them and to all our heroes. Thanks to which we are holding on. And we’re doing it pretty well. And Ukraine lives. Glory to Ukraine!

That is why I want to remind you of the words of a great woman from Kyiv, whom you know very well. The words of Golda Meir. They are very famous, everyone has heard of them. Apparently, every Jew. Many, many Ukrainians as well. And certainly no less Russians. ""We intend to remain alive. Our neighbors want to see us dead. This is not a question that leaves much room for compromise."" I don't need to convince you how intertwined our stories are. Stories of Ukrainians and Jews. In the past, and now, in this terrible time. We are in different countries and in completely different conditions. But the threat is the same: for both us and you - the total destruction of the people, state, culture. And even of the names: Ukraine, Israel. I want you to feel it all. I want you to think about this date. About February 24. About the beginning of this invasion. Russia's invasion of Ukraine. February 24 - this day has twice gone down in history. And both times - as a tragedy. A tragedy for Ukrainians, for Jews, for Europe, for the world. On February 24, 1920, the National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (NSDAP) was founded. A party that took millions of lives. Destroyed entire countries. Tried to kill nations. 102 years later, on February 24, a criminal order was issued to launch a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The invasion, which has claimed thousands of lives, has left millions homeless. Made them exiles. On their land and in neighboring countries. In Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Baltic States and dozens of different countries. Our people are now scattered around the world. They are looking for security. They are looking for a way to stay in peace. As you once searched. This Russian invasion of Ukraine is not just a military operation, as Moscow claims. This is a large-scale and treacherous war aimed at destroying our people. Destroying our children, our families. Our state. Our cities. Our communities. Our culture. And everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Everything that Russian troops are now destroying. Deliberately. In front of the whole world. That is why I have the right to this parallel and to this comparison. Our history and your history. Our war for our survival and World War II. Listen to what the Kremlin says. Just listen! There are even terms that sounded then. And this is a tragedy. When the Nazi party raided Europe and wanted to destroy everything. Destroy everyone. Wanted to conquer the nations. And leave nothing from us, nothing from you. Even the name and the trace. They called it ""the final solution to the Jewish issue"". You remember that. And I'm sure you will never forget! But listen to what is sounding now in Moscow. Hear how these words are said again: ""Final solution"". But already in relation, so to speak, to us, to the ""Ukrainian issue"". It sounded openly. This is a tragedy. Once again, it was said at a meeting in Moscow. It is available on official websites. This was quoted in the state media of Russia. Moscow says so: without the war against us, they would not be able to ensure a ""final solution"" allegedly for their own security. Just like it was said 80 years ago. People of Israel! You saw Russian missiles hit Kyiv, Babyn Yar. You know what kind of land it is. More than 100,000 Holocaust victims are buried there. There are ancient Kyiv cemeteries. There is a Jewish cemetery. Russian missiles hit there. People of Israel! On the first day of this war, Russian projectiles hit our city of Uman. A city visited by tens of thousands of Israelis every year. For a pilgrimage to the tomb of Nachman of Breslov. What will be left of all such places in Ukraine after this terrible war? I am sure that every word of my address echoes with pain in your hearts. Because you feel what I'm talking about. But can you explain why we still turn to the whole world, to many countries for help? We ask you for help... Even for basic visas... What is it? Indifference? Premeditation? Or mediation without choosing a party? I will leave you a choice of answer to this question. And I will note only one thing - indifference kills. Premeditation is often erroneous. And mediation can be between states, not between good and evil. Everyone in Israel knows that your missile defense is the best. It is powerful. Everyone knows that your weapon is strong. Everyone knows you're doing great. You know how to defend your state interests, the interests of your people. And you can definitely help us protect our lives, the lives of Ukrainians, the lives of Ukrainian Jews. One can keep asking why we can't get weapons from you. Or why Israel has not imposed strong sanctions against Russia. Why it doesn’t put pressure on Russian business. But it is up to you, dear brothers and sisters, to choose the answer. And you will have to live with this answer, people of Israel. Ukrainians have made their choice. 80 years ago. They rescued Jews. That is why the Righteous Among the Nations are among us. People of Israel, now you have such a choice. Thank you! Thank you for everything.

0,"Our strong people of our indomitable country! The 24th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is over. After eight years of aggression. Ukrainians have proved that they know how to fight more professionally than an army that has been fighting for decades in different regions and under different conditions. We respond with wisdom and courage to the huge number of their equipment and soldiers sent to Ukraine. That is why, for example, the Ukrainian Chornobaivka will go down in war history. This is a place where the Russian military and their commanders have shown themselves completely as they are: incompetent, capable of simply driving their people to slaughter. Six times our military destroyed the occupiers near Chornobaivka. Six times! And they still come there. The besieged Mariupol will go down in history of responsibility for war crimes. The terror the occupiers did to the peaceful city will be remembered for centuries to come. And the more Ukrainians tell the world about it, the more support we find. The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences will be for it. Today I addressed the people of Switzerland. This is a special state. It does not elbow its way on the international stage. But when it speaks its word, it is heard by absolutely everyone. Switzerland has backed European Union sanctions against Russia. This means a lot for the Russian state machine. For people who are used to the fact that power is money. Hence, banks. Hence, Switzerland and other countries that help save capital. I am grateful to the President and to the people of Switzerland and to their country for their sincere support in our struggle for life and liberty. For not staying away. And I urged them to take a few more steps. So that all Swiss companies that have not yet left the Russian market do so immediately in order not to give a single dollar, franc or euro to a Russian military machine to kill our people. So that all those responsible for the war against our state cannot enjoy life in Switzerland, real estate in Switzerland, banks in Switzerland. Our Armed Forces continue to deter the enemy in all major areas. Inflict unprecedented losses on Russian troops. Some units of the occupiers were destroyed by 80-90%. In places of especially fierce battles, the frontline of our defense is simply piled with the corpses of Russian soldiers. And these corpses, these bodies, are not taken away. New units are driven on the offensive through these bodies. Some reserves that the command of the Russian troops collect wherever they can. We are well aware that Russia has just a bottomless human resource and a lot of equipment, missiles and bombs. But I want to ask the citizens of Russia. What have they done to you over the years that you stopped noticing your losses? Do the words “son”, “mother”, “father” mean nothing to you anymore? Already more than 14 thousand of your soldiers have been killed. This is 14 thousand mothers. This is 14 thousand fathers. These are wives, these are children, relatives and friends. And you don't notice it? But there will only be more victims. As long as this war continues. Your war against us, Russia against Ukraine. On our land. Eight humanitarian corridors worked on Saturday. 6623 people were rescued. Due to the shelling of the occupiers, we were unable to rescue people from Borodyanka, Kyiv region. But we will not abandon these attempts. Ukrainians were evacuated from Bervytsya, Bucha, and Bohdanivka to Brovary. People were taken to Bakhmut from Lysychansk, Popasna, Severodonetsk, and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region. More than 4000 Mariupol residents managed to leave for Zaporizhzhia. Unfortunately, it was not possible to deliver the humanitarian cargo to the cities of the Kherson region. Russian troops blocked the movement of our convoy. Why? Their goal has not changed - in the same way they try to portray in their propaganda that Ukraine has left its citizens without the essentials. As if Russia is constantly saving them from something. Although on February 23 our Kherson residents had more than the regions of Russia itself. I spoke today with French President Macron. About our interaction. About finding a solution for peace, for the liberation of our territories. To save our people. I am sure you understand that negotiations are not easy and pleasant. But they are needed. Because it's about life. Ukraine has always sought a peaceful solution. The more we are interested in peace now. Because we count everyone killed. Because every ruined family, every ruined house matters to us. Because we are Ukrainians, and for us a person is priceless. Today I signed a decree on awarding 161 of our defenders with state awards of Ukraine. 40 of them posthumously. And the decree on awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to 12 servicemen. 8 of them posthumously. I also met with warriors of the special unit of the National Police of Ukraine KORD to award them. I thanked them for their service, for the protection of our peaceful cities and for their help to the army. In total, during the days of the full-scale war, 70 of our defenders have already been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. 2180 Ukrainians were awarded orders and medals for courage, for saving brothers-in-arms and civilians, for effective actions in defense of the state. I am sure I can say on behalf of all our Ukrainian people: we are sincerely grateful to each of you. To each and everyone who defends our state and stops the army of occupiers, which was called one of the few most powerful in the world. Ukrainian poet Lina Kostenko celebrates her birthday on March 19. I sincerely congratulate you. On behalf of all Ukrainians. And let me remind you today her words: [Quotes Lina Kostenko’s poem] In fact, each of us has a nation. And we should not think meanly. Especially those whom Ukrainians have given the right to be politicians. I want to remind all politicians from any camp: wartime shows very well the meanness of personal ambitions of those who try to put their own ambitions, their own party or career above the interests of the state, the interests of the people. Those who hide somewhere in the rear, but pretend to be the only one who cares about defense. Any activity of politicians aimed at splitting or collaborating will not succeed. But it will get a tough response. That is why the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine decided… Given the full-scale war waged by the Russian Federation and the ties of some political structures with this state, any activity of a number of political parties during the martial law is suspended. Namely: ""Opposition Platform - For Life"", ""Shariy Party"", ""Nashi"", ""Opposition Bloc"", ""Left Opposition"", ""Union of Left Forces"", ""State"", ""Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine"", ""Socialist Party of Ukraine”, “Socialists” Party, “Volodymyr Saldo Bloc”. The Ministry of Justice is instructed to immediately take comprehensive measures to ban the activities of these political parties in the prescribed manner. Everyone must now take care of the interests of our state, the interests of Ukraine. Because it's for us. Because it is for the sake of life. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine ",1222,0.097,0.727,0.17600000000000002,0.9989,20 March 2022  - 02:33 ,20 March 2022,1,"The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences will be for it - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",2022,March,20,"The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences will be for it - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy - 20 March 2022  - 02:33 ",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/sho-bilshe-rosiya-zastosovuye-teroru-proti-ukrayini-girshi-n-73685,2022-03-20,3
0,"My greetings to all Swiss friends of Ukraine! To all your beautiful people, the people of Switzerland! I am grateful to you for supporting our people. Thank you for defending freedom together with all those who value it. This is very important now. Nowadays. At a special time period. And especially important - from you. When terror became the national idea of one of the largest nations in the world. The basis of their foreign policy. When the crimes of terrorism are committed not by some outcast or group of persons and not by an organization, but by the state. Which has a nuclear arsenal. When a permanent member of the UN Security Council deliberately destroys everything for which the UN was built. Having unleashed a cruel, bloody, senseless war against us. But we now have a chance. A chance to show not only to Russia, but also to any aggressor in the world, any terrorist state, that war will destroy not the victim, but the one who came with it. And, perhaps, this is the last chance for humanity - to stop the wars. Stop the state terror. And I'm telling you now. Switzerland. A state that has a very long history of peace. And an even longer history of influence. In many areas - a decisive influence on the world. Even before I became President, I was thinking what life of our beloved Ukrainians I would like to see. I have often been to your country. And I know very well how you live. And one day, standing near Chillon Castle, I asked my friends - we were one company - why can't we live like this? To have such a standard of living. A high level. And with the same freedom. In such friendly communities. And with such confidence in our own strength. And I sincerely wanted the Ukrainians to live like the Swiss. So that we can jointly decide everything about our own lives. About our land. Not expecting anything from politicians, unnecessary words, but voting in a referendum. So that we can be sure, despite all the financial crises in the world, that our state will withstand and remain a leader. A leader of trust, a leader of stability. A dream for all people. Successful, not very successful - no matter what level, just for all people. So that the Ukrainians, like the Swiss, can feel that they live in real communities that care about what is common to all - for the good of all. Maybe these are all ordinary things to you. For us, these are reforms. And this is the path we are taking and we wanted to take. And we passed the relevant laws. For all this to work. We gave opportunities. Opportunities for our people. So that we gradually reach your standard of living. And we did it until the black day. February 24. The day of the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of our land, Ukraine. And then everything changed. It has changed for each of us, Ukrainians. I'm sure it has changed for all Europeans. And it has changed for all world democracies. It has changed for you, too. I am grateful to you and your state for supporting us in such a difficult time. I am thankful that you did not stay away, didn't say that it wasn't related to you at all Because, in fact, it is impossible to stay away from the fact that in the 21st century, in the heart of Europe, hundreds of rockets and bombs are flying at peaceful cities. It is impossible to stay away when the army of the world's largest state, albeit only in size, directs all its deadly potential to destroy us, to destroy hospitals, ordinary schools, churches, universities, maternity hospitals, residential areas. It is impossible to be indifferent when children are killed. As of this morning, the Russian army has killed 112 Ukrainian children. And just as I wanted the Ukrainians to live like the Swiss... I also want you to be and become like the Ukrainians. In the fight against evil. So that there is no question about banks. About your banks. Where the money of all those who started this war is kept. It's painful and it's hard. But it is also a struggle against evil. It is necessary to completely freeze all the assets of these people and their accounts. It's a big fight, and you can do it. I want you to become Ukrainians who feel what it is like when whole cities are destroyed, peaceful cities. Destroyed on the orders of those who like to live in communities - different, European, in your communities, in beautiful Swiss communities. Who enjoys real estate in your country. And it would be fair to deprive them of this privilege. To deprive of what they are taking from us. And I want you to be as Ukrainians in the issue of business. Business that works in Russia in spite of everything. Despite this war. Despite all our murdered children. Despite the people killed. Despite the destroyed cities. Like our city of Mariupol, heroic Mariupol, which has been under complete blockade for weeks. Imagine - no food, no water, no electricity. Just under the bombs. ""Good food. Good life."" This is the slogan of Nestlé. Your company that refuses to leave Russia. Even now - when there are threats from Russia to other European countries. Not only to us. When there is even nuclear blackmail from Russia. And I want all of you, Swiss people, to become like all of us, Ukrainians. I want us not to lose our common chance now. A chance to restore peace, a chance to stop any wars in the world. Because when Switzerland is with you, you are definitely successful. Because when Ukraine is with you, you are definitely strong. Last year we agreed on a big conference with the President of your country. Conference in Lugano. For the sake of economic transformation, for the sake of Ukraine's reforms. It was to take place this July. As well as the next summit of the first ladies and gentlemen. And I believe, I know we can hold them. This year. On your land. For the restoration and development of Ukraine. So that you have the opportunity to show again and again all the best that is in your hearts. In our hearts. In the hearts of all those people who are fighting for freedom and fighting for life. I am grateful to you. I am grateful to Switzerland! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Good evening to everyone. Usually on such days we used to say: “Spring has come”.  But now we are saying: “War has come”. But we will definitely defeat everyone no matter what. Because we are free people of a free country. Today, government officials have elaborated the decision to fully reboot the customs service. Cargo for our defense, for our people will be brought into Ukraine as easily as the physics laws allow that.  We eliminate the whole bureaucracy, all paperwork, VAT, all customs duties.  The goal is clear - to prevent the human factor from hindering the speedy supply of goods, which are really needed now.  Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk and profile committees are working to ensure the support of people’s deputies for the innovations. I emphasize: this decision is necessary for the defense of the state, for ensuring normal life during martial law.  I urge certain MPs not to speculate on this issue, as it is for the benefit of our state, not the government or the opposition. We must all work jointly for the sake of our Ukraine, our people. Let’s think about PR after the victory.  Another important area of government work is helping Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes due to hostilities. I commissioned the Cabinet of Ministers to develop a comprehensive program to support such people, our citizens. Everyone who was deprived of home because of the war. We already have the outlines of this program. The first component is financial. State support for all displaced persons. Adults and children. Government support for jobs for such people - where they are temporarily staying. So that every person, every family has a basis for life. The second component is housing. The government is preparing concrete proposals for housing for IDPs right now. And also organizes the reconstruction of destroyed housing after the war. The third component is no less important. This is the support for the families who have housed people from areas of hostilities or temporary occupation. At a minimum, they will be reimbursed for the cost of utilities related to the stay of IDPs. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal will soon explain all the details of such a comprehensive program to support our citizens. A coordination headquarters has been set up to regulate all issues related to the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Under the chairmanship of Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak, a meeting was held with Ukrainian ambassadors to intensify the supply of humanitarian goods to Ukraine, primarily to help internally displaced persons. I also commissioned the government to provide assistance together with the International Committee of the Red Cross to those of our citizens who found themselves abroad after February 24 and need the attention of our state and international organizations. Today there were seven humanitarian corridors in Ukraine. Six - in the Sumy region, one - in the Donetsk region. More than 9,000 people were evacuated from the besieged Mariupol. In total, more than 180,000 Ukrainians have been rescued by the humanitarian corridors. Hundreds of tons of essential products were delivered. But the occupiers continue to block the supply of humanitarian aid to the besieged cities in most areas. This is a totally deliberate tactic. They have a clear order to do absolutely everything to make the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities an ""argument"" for Ukrainians to cooperate with the occupiers. This is a war crime. They will be held accountable for this. 100%. Every Russian figure who gives such orders and every Russian soldier who carries out such orders will be identified. And will receive a compulsory one-way ticket to The Hague. To the city where the International Criminal Court is located. People are being rescued from the rubble of the drama theater destroyed by the occupiers in Mariupol, where civilians had been hiding from Russian shelling and bombs. More than 130 people are already on the surface. Some of them are seriously wounded. But at the moment there is no information about the dead. Thanks to the courage and professional training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the occupation forces were stopped in almost all directions. Heavy fighting in the Kharkiv region - especially heavy near Izyum. Russian troops have already thrown people from training centers there. Absolutely unprepared contingent. People who can't endure half an hour in battle. Kyiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, the south of our state - the army stopped the occupiers. The initial plan of the Russian military to seize our state failed. And it seems that they do not know what else can be done to us. It seems that their military commanders are not able to offer their political leadership anything but cruel and erroneous tactics to exhaust us, to exhaust Ukraine. Nothing but constant strikes at the civilian population, peaceful cities, people, children, missiles, air bombs, shelling from ""Grads"", ""Uragans"". Nothing but the destruction of non-military infrastructure - residential buildings, hospitals, schools, churches. But this tactic of their military only worsens the situation for the Russian state. Leads to new and new destructive sanctions. Encourages new members to join our anti-war coalition. It allows us to unite even those states that have always tried to remain neutral to put pressure on Russia. Therefore, negotiations on peace, on security for us, for Ukraine - meaningful, fair and without delay - are the only chance for Russia to reduce the damage from its own mistakes. We have always insisted on negotiations. We have always offered dialogue, offered solutions for peace. Not only during 23 days of invasion. And I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. It's time to meet. Time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be so huge that several generations will not be enough to rebound. Many words were heard in Moscow today in connection with the anniversary of the seizure of Crimea. A big rally took place. And I want to pay attention to one detail. It is reported that a total of about 200,000 people were involved in the rally in the Russian capital. 100,000 on the streets, about 95,000 at the stadium. Approximately the same number of Russian troops were involved in the invasion of Ukraine. Just imagine 14 thousand corpses and tens of thousands of wounded and maimed people at that stadium in Moscow. There are already so many Russian losses as a result of this invasion. This is the price of war. In a little more than three weeks. The war must end. Ukraine's proposals are on the table. In the coming days, I will continue to appeal to the nations of the world to call for peace for Ukraine. My appeal to the Swiss people is ahead, to the people and to the state. Appeals to Israel, Italy and Japan are also planned. The world hears Ukraine's position. The world supports our defenders, defenders of Ukraine. Today I want to express my sincere gratitude to each defender of our strong Mariupol. Our heroic city, which is experiencing the greatest ordeal in its history, in the history of Ukraine. 36th Separate Marine Brigade. 501st Separate Marine Battalion. 1st Separate Marine Battalion. 12th Brigade of the National Guard. And a separate detachment of special purpose ""Azov"". I am grateful to each and every one of our defenders of Mariupol. I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine. Also at the request of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine I decided to confer the title of Hero of Ukraine upon: Colonel Baranyuk Volodymyr Anatoliyovych, Commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade. And Major Prokopenko Denys Hennadiyovych, Commander of a separate detachment of special purpose ""Azov"". For courage, for effective actions to repel enemy attacks, for the defense of the hero city of Mariupol. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Strong people of the indomitable country! The 23rd day of our patriotic war continues. After eight years of war in the east. The occupiers do not stop burning their national wealth in the war against Ukraine. I am confident that by attacking us, they will destroy everything that Russian society has achieved over the past 25 years. And they will return to where they once began to rise from, as they say, to the ""the wicked 90's"". But without freedom, without the creative desire of millions of people to work for the development of their state. This will be the price of war against Ukraine for Russia. It will be a fall for them, a painful fall. And they will feel it even in spite of the ""opium for the people"" from television propagandists. Unjust and aggressive war always has a high price for the aggressor. But no matter what happens to them, it cannot comfort us. It will not resurrect our dead people. It will not restore our cities. It will not heal the emotional wound that will stay with us forever. We will rebuild everything - I have no doubt about that. We will become a full member of the EU - each representative of our state works for this 24/7. But life will be different, and for many - without the thousands of hearts stopped by this war. May the memory of everyone who gave life for Ukraine live forever! Russian troops have continued treacherous shelling of our peaceful cities and our communities. Lviv, Kyiv and the region, Zhytomyr region, Sumy region, Kharkiv and the region, Chernihiv, cities of Donbas - Severodonetsk, Kramatorsk, our Mariupol... Missile strikes, air bombs, ""Grads"". We are shooting down Russian missiles as much as we can. We are destroying their planes and helicopters. And this despite the fact that we do not yet have adequate anti-missile weapons. Advanced weapons. We do not have enough combat aircraft. But we have a goal, pure and fair - to protect our people, our state. Undoubtedly, we will continue to do everything we can. We will remind some Western leaders even louder that this will be a moral defeat for them, it will destroy their prestige if Ukraine does not receive advanced weapons that will really save the lives of thousands of our people. Russian missiles will not fall from shotguns, which some are trying to replace really useful supplies with. Today is a busy day of negotiations for me. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. Charles Michel, President of the European Council. Ukraine's great friend, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. The subject is clear. First, these are concrete steps that will give Ukraine even more strength, not only directly for the defense, but also for the economy. For our people, for Ukrainians who really defend Europe. Here and now. On our land. President Ursula von der Leyen has promised to do everything possible to speed up Ukraine's accession to the EU. We reduce bureaucratic processes for our state, which usually take years, to weeks, to months. It's not easy, but we do it. I am sure. We also agreed on the EU’s support for Ukrainians who were forced to flee their homes due to the war. For those who are abroad and within our state. We agreed on a new macro-financial aid - another 300 million euros for Ukraine. In addition to those on which a decision has already been made. Secondly, we are discussing the next package of sanctions against Russia. Significant enough. To make them feel that every missile against our state, every bomb, every shot has its price. For the Russian budget, for Russian companies, for Russian ambitions and for specific people who represent the Russian government. And until there is peace for Ukraine, sanctions against Russia must grow steadily. I am grateful to all public initiatives from around the world that offer restrictions for Russia not only at the state level, but also at the level of societies. In particular, I am grateful to the Swedish Port Workers' Union, which promises not to service vessels connected with Russia. This is right. This is a good example for all public structures, all trade unions and business associations to follow. If Russia is not stopped now, if Russia is not punished now, other aggressors in the world will start other wars. In different regions of the world. On different continents. Wherever a state dreams of conquering its neighbors. We need to act now so that all other potential aggressors see that war is only a loss and no benefit. That is why it is necessary for all Europeans to block ports for all Russian ships. So that all Russian commercial vessels follow the Russian warship. It is necessary that all Western companies leave the Russian market and not cover with cheap PR their thirst for profit despite blood, despite war crimes. Like Nestle or Auchan for example. To date, humanitarian corridors in the Sumy, Donetsk and Kharkiv regions have been agreed upon. Sumy, Konotop, Trostyanets, Lebedyn, Krasnopillya, Velyka Pysarivka. It is especially difficult from the besieged Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. The occupiers are doing everything to complicate the movement of people and prevent Ukrainian humanitarian cargo from entering the city. This is outright terror. But we try, we do our best. More than 35,000 people have already been rescued from Mariupol. Rescue work is underway at the site of the bombing by the occupiers of the theater where Mariupol residents hid from shelling, used it as a shelter. It is known that as of now, more than 130 people were rescued. But hundreds of Mariupol residents are still under the debris. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue rescue work. The situation in the Kharkiv region is very difficult. The occupiers do not stop trying to destroy our city of Izyum. People in Balakliya are being tortured. Our team is doing everything to organize a working humanitarian corridor to these cities and deliver food, water and medicine. I instructed the Cabinet of Ministers, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council and the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada to develop a format of decisions that will speed up the supply of all necessary goods from abroad. This is especially topical for food, fuel and other goods that meet the basic needs of society. War is not a time for bureaucrats and careerists from different departments to complicate the provision of goods for people. We want to simplify the passage of goods that Ukrainians need now through customs as much as possible. If this requires the removal of taxes and excises during martial law, we are ready to do so. If it is necessary to remove customs officers who do not understand the tasks of wartime to act quickly, we will do so. Our borders must be open to everything Ukrainians need. I am waiting for the appropriate decisions by the end of the day. And then - the support from people's deputies. Because now everyone has to work only for Ukrainians, only for our state, for defense. Not for ambitions. Not for fear. Not for bureaucracy. Everything is for the protection of Ukraine! Today I signed a decree on the awarding of state awards to 138 servicemen of the Armed Forces. In particular, the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the II degree is awarded to: Syrskyi Oleksandr Stanislavovych, Commander of the Land Forces. Since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, he has been leading the defense of Kyiv. Thanks to his professional and courageous actions, the enemy suffered significant losses and was driven away from the capital. During the defense of Kyiv, more than 30 settlements in the Kyiv region, which were temporarily occupied by the enemy, were liberated. Major Mazurok Taras Leonidovych, commander of the tank battalion. Defending the Donetsk region, he inflicted significant losses on the enemy and significantly stopped his advance. Sergeant Nutsa Ruslana Vasylivna was awarded the Order of Courage of the III degree. Senior combat medic. She personally took part in the evacuation of the wounded from Vodyane, Shyrokyne and Mariupol. Thanks to her actions, 31 of our defenders were saved. She continues to perform tasks in Mariupol. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Great people of a great country! The 22nd day of our struggle, our defense against one of the world's largest armies is over. Which we make smaller every day. Every day. But it still has numbers, equipment and reserves. We have information that the Russian military is recruiting mercenaries from other countries, trying to deceive as many young people as possible into military service. We know that this will not help them. So now I warn everyone who will try to join the occupiers on our Ukrainian land. This will be the worst decision of your life. Long life is better than the money you are offered for a short one. Our courageous defenders continue to hold all the key areas that the enemy is pressing. And respond to every attack. To every blow of the occupiers to our peaceful cities, to our people. New Russian conscripts have been taken prisoner. Among them are those who refuse to return to Russia. And there are many who are not even mentioned in Russia. They don't even try to take them back. Their death notifications have been sent to their families although they are in captivity and alive. All Russians who can hear me now, speak about it. Tell it in Russia. Every mother who knows that her son was sent to war against Ukraine must check where her son is. And especially those who cannot contact their children, who have been told that their children had been killed. And who didn't receive the bodies. There are phone numbers on the Internet that you can call and find out what is really happening to your children. We did not plan to take thousands of prisoners. We do not need 13 or any number of thousands of dead Russian soldiers. We do not need it. We didn't want this war. We only want peace. And we want you to love your children more than you fear your authorities. I addressed the parliament of Germany today. One of the most influential countries in the world. In Europe. One of the natural leaders of the European continent. I spoke not just as President, but as a Ukrainian citizen. As a European. As someone who has felt for many years that the German state seems to have fenced itself off us with a wall. Invisible yet solid wall. We have seen Germany fight for the economy for decades. For new Russian gas pipelines and old European dreams. Dreams of some kind of cooperation that Russia has not taken seriously for a long time. We see that the views of the Germans are changing. And this is very important. We see Germany looking for a new path. We see how sincerely the majority of Germans stand in favor of revising the old policy. We see that Chancellor Olaf Scholz has a great chance, a great mission - to give Germany a renewed leadership. Give Europe peace. Long-lasting and most importantly - fair. One that guarantees security to every state in Europe and Ukraine in the first place. And I sincerely wish Chancellor Scholz from all Ukrainians, from all Europeans that Germany and its partners succeed in carrying out this mission. I will continue such speeches in the parliaments and squares of the partner states. Necessarily. As much as it takes to stop the war. To restore our territorial integrity. To return to all of us, Ukrainians and all Europeans, the long-awaited peace. I feel that we are being increasingly understood. In Europe, in the world, in different countries. And it gives us more and more support. The one we have been asking for for so long. I spoke with French President Macron. We are strengthening the defense of Ukraine. We coordinated our joint steps towards peace. I’m grateful for that. I am also grateful to President Biden for his new and effective support for our country. Please, understand: I can't reveal all the details of this support package and others to you. Because this is our tactic. Our defense. When the enemy does not know what to expect from us. Just as they did not know what would await them after February 24. Didn't know what we had for the defense and how we were preparing to face the attack. The occupiers thought they were going to Ukraine, which they had seen before, in 2014-2015. Which they constantly corrupted and which they were not afraid of. But we are different. And this allows us to defend ourselves against a full-scale strike for 22 days already. Everything we have done in a few years. For our defense. For our tactics. For defense tactics, which is not the time to reveal while the war is going on. It is not the time to reveal our tactics of negotiations as well. Negotiations for peace, sovereignty, territorial integrity of our state, our freedom. Working more in silence than on television, radio or Facebook. I think this is right. Today I visited the wonderful Vlasenko family from Vorzel, Kyiv region, at the hospital. Escaping, they got under Russian shelling. The eldest daughter, Katya, who is only 16 years old, covered her brother Ihor, who is 8. The brother got out of the car and cursed the occupiers. Tetiana, mother, received shrapnel wounds. The father carried his daughter in his arms. Thank God they all survived. Because they stayed together, as a family, and defended each other. I was really moved to talk to them. Probably the most during this war. I sincerely wish health and happiness to this family, the Vlasenko family. Like all other families. I wish you peace and work for it. Also today, I awarded five employees of the State Emergency Service with the Order of Courage. Everyone is a hero. Everyone was awarded for selfless actions, for dedication with which they save all of us, save Ukrainians. And some more news, very important and, of course, positive. About our economy. About how we bring our country back to life. Right now, wherever security allows. Wherever business can run. Our government has already prepared a decision to expand the lending program for entrepreneurs on the basis of the program ""5-7-9%"" creating a new opportunity. Any business will be able to get a loan at 0%. For the time of martial law plus 1 month after the war. Then there will be a minimum rate of 5%. And the total loan amount can be up to 60 million hryvnias. So that a wider range of businesses can take advantage of our program. The second news is that the Cabinet of Ministers will vote tomorrow for a large-scale reduction of regulations. There were more than 600 permits and licenses for business, and about 20 remain mandatory. Only those that simply cannot be revoked. For example, radioactive waste management. So, for the vast majority of businesses in Ukraine, the declarative principle will work: you have announced the start of business and you work freely. And the third news, which concerns millions of Ukrainians. This is a special task for the National Bank of Ukraine, for people's deputies and our government officials. I instructed to find such a legislative opportunity for the state to guarantee 100% of deposits in Ukrainian banks. 100%. Not part, as now, as always, but 100%. The whole deposit. In any bank of our state. So that people do not lose money and are not afraid of it under any circumstances. So I'm waiting for specifics. Draft decision. And I hope that the Verkhovna Rada will not delay the support. Because Ukrainians need it. Ukraine needs this. And finally. Our Mariupol, our Kharkiv, our Chernihiv, Kyiv region, Izyum and all our hero cities. Which are in a very difficult situation. Extremely difficult. We are doing everything. All of us. Absolutely. Our army, police, SES, humanitarian convoys, church... All our people. We will not leave you. And we will not forgive them. You will be free. Definitely. I know it. Like all of us on our land. Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear President Göring-Eckardt. Dear ladies and gentlemen, deputies, guests, journalists. German people! I am addressing you after three weeks of full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, after eight years of war in the east of my country, in Donbas. I appeal to you when Russia is bombing our cities, destroying everything in Ukraine. Everything - houses, hospitals, schools, churches. Using missiles, air bombs, rocket artillery. Thousands of Ukrainians died in three weeks. The occupiers killed 108 children. In the middle of Europe, in our country, in 2022. I am addressing you after numerous meetings, negotiations, statements and requests. After steps in support, some of which are overdue. After sanctions, which are obviously not enough to stop this war. And after we saw how many ties your companies still have with Russia. With a state that just uses you and some other countries to finance the war. During the three weeks of war for our lives, for our freedom, we became convinced of what we had felt before. And what you probably do not all notice yet. You are like behind the wall again. Not the Berlin Wall. But in the middle of Europe. Between freedom and slavery. And this wall grows stronger with each bomb that falls on our land, on Ukraine. With every decision that is not made for the sake of peace. Not approved by you, although it may help. When did it happen? Dear politicians. Dear German people. Why is this possible? When we told you that Nord Stream was a weapon and a preparation for a great war, we heard in response that it was an economy after all. Economy. Economy. But it was cement for a new wall. When we asked you what Ukraine needs to do to become a member of NATO, to be safe, to receive security guarantees, we heard the answer: such a decision is not on the table yet and will not be in the near future. Just as the chair for us at this table. Just as you are still delaying the issue of Ukraine's accession to the European Union. Frankly, for some it is politics. The truth is that it is stones. Stones for a new wall. When we asked for preventive sanctions, we appealed to Europe, we appealed to many countries. We turned to you. Sanctions for the aggressor to feel that you are a force. We saw delays. We felt resistance. We understood that you want to continue the economy. Economy. Economy. And now the trade routes between you and the country that has once again brought a brutal war to Europe are barbed wire over the wall. Over the new wall that divides Europe. And you don't see what's behind this wall, and it's between us, between people in Europe. And because of this, not everyone is fully aware of what we are going through today. I am addressing you on behalf of Ukrainians, I am addressing you on behalf of Mariupol residents - civilians of a city that Russian troops have blocked and razed to the ground. They just destroy everything there. Everything and everyone who is there. Hundreds of thousands of people are under shelling around the clock. No food, 24 hours a day without water, no electricity, 24 hours a day without communication. For weeks. Russian troops do not distinguish between civilians and military. They don’t care where civilian objects are, everything is considered a target. A theater that was a shelter for hundreds of people and was blown up yesterday, a maternity hospital, a children's hospital, residential areas without any military facilities - they are destroying everything. Round the clock. And they do not let any humanitarian cargo into our blocked city. For five days, Russian troops have not stopped the shelling specifically to prevent the rescue of our people. You can see it all. If you climb over this Wall. If you remember what the Berlin Airlift meant to you. Which could be realized because the sky was safe. You were not killed from the sky as now in our country, when we cannot even make an airlift! When the sky gives only Russian missiles and air bombs. I am addressing you on behalf of older Ukrainians. Many survivors of World War II. Those who escaped during the occupation 80 years ago. Those who survived Babyn Yar. Babyn Yar that President Steinmeier visited last year. On the 80th anniversary of the tragedy. And that was hit by Russian missiles now. It is exactly this place that was hit. And the missile strike killed the family that went to Babyn Yar, to the monument. Killed again, 80 years after. I appeal to you on behalf of everyone who has heard politicians say: ""Never again."" And who saw that these words are worthless. Because again in Europe they are trying to destroy the whole nation. Destroy everything we live by and live for. I am addressing you on behalf of our military. Those who defend our state, and therefore the values that are often talked about everywhere in Europe, everywhere - and in Germany as well. Freedom and equality. Opportunity to live freely, not to submit to another state, which considers a foreign land its ""living space"". Why are they defending all this without your leadership? Without your strength? Why are overseas states closer to us than you are? Because this is the Wall. The wall that someone doesn't notice and that we are hammering on while fighting to save our people. Ladies and Gentlemen! German people! I am grateful to everyone who supports us. I am grateful to you. Ordinary Germans who sincerely help Ukrainians on your land. To journalists who do their job honestly, showing all the evil that Russia has brought to us. I am grateful to the German businessmen who put morality and humanity above accounting. Above the economy. Economy. Economy. And I am grateful to the politicians who are still trying... Trying to break this Wall. Who choose life between Russian money and the deaths of Ukrainian children. Who support the strengthening of sanctions against Russia that can guarantee peace. Peace to Ukraine. Peace to Europe. Who do not hesitate to disconnect Russia from SWIFT. Who know that an embargo on trade with Russia is needed. On imports of everything that sponsors this war. Who know that Ukraine will be in the European Union. Because Ukraine is already more Europe than many others. I am grateful to everyone who is taller than any wall. And who knows that the stronger one bears more responsibility when it comes to saving people. It is difficult for us to endure without the help of the world, without your help. It is difficult to defend Ukraine, Europe without what you can do. So that you don’t look over your shoulder even after this war. After the destruction of Kharkiv... For the second time in 80 years. After the bombing of Chernihiv, Sumy and Donbas. For the second time in 80 years. After thousands of people tortured and killed. For the second time in 80 years. Otherwise, what is the historical responsibility to the Ukrainian people still not redeemed for what happened 80 years ago? And now - so that a new one does not appear, behind the new Wall, which will again demand redemption. I appeal to you and remind you of what is needed. The things without which Europe will not survive and will not preserve its values. Former actor, President of the United States Ronald Reagan once said in Berlin: Tear down this wall! And I want to tell you now. Chancellor Scholz! Tear down this wall. Give Germany the leadership you deserve. And what your descendants will be proud of. Support us. Support peace. Support every Ukrainian. Stop the war. Help us stop it. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Wise people of a strong country! We have finally managed to release the mayor of Melitopol from captivity. Our Ukrainian Melitopol, which did not submit and will not submit to the occupiers. Ivan Fedorov is free. I talked to him today. The Russian military abducted him on March 11, trying to persuade him to collaborate. But our man withstood. He did not give up. Just as we all endure. You all. Just as we all do not give up. Because we are Ukrainians. And we always protect our own.  Today a protest action took place in Berdyansk again. Protest against the occupiers from the Russian Federation. Thousands of brave civilians came out against the armed Russian military. And they told them everything, everything they deserve. It is very important. I know it's hard. But it is also important that what they heard from our people, including in Russian, is clear and unambiguous: occupiers, go home. There is still such an opportunity. Every soldier thrown into the territory of our country has such an opportunity. Everyone who has not yet been killed, wounded or taken prisoner. Russian troops suffer such losses in Ukraine, which were inflicted neither in Syria, nor in Chechnya. Neither did the Soviet troops suffer such losses in Afghanistan. If your war, the war against the Ukrainian people, continues, the mothers of Russia will lose more children than in the Afghan and Chechen wars combined. What’s the point of it? Every Russian soldier who lays down weapons will get a chance, a chance to survive. I appeal specifically to the conscripts who were thrown into the furnace of this war. Not your war. And to the rest of the Russian soldiers who still have the instinct of self-preservation. Lay down your weapons. It's better than dying on the battlefield, on our land. Unfortunately, the humanitarian corridors did not work on Wednesday. The Russian military did not stop shelling, did not guarantee security. We are ready to ensure silence. We are ready to take people out and send humanitarian aid. But we can't expose people to shelling on the road. Understand us. Expose to the fact that for the Russian military there is no such war crime, which they would not commit. We are taking away Mariupol residents who managed to escape to Berdyansk... We are taking them to Zaporizhzhia. In total, more than 6,000 Mariupol residents were transported in one day, more than 2,000 of them are children. The Russian military tried to disrupt this movement as well. They opened mortar fire on the section of the road between Vasylivka and Kamyanske in the Zaporizhzhia region. Only by a miracle there were no casualties. Five Ukrainians were wounded, including two children. In Chernihiv, the occupiers fired at civilians who were simply standing in line for bread. Imagine. Ten dead people. In Mariupol, in besieged Mariupol, Russian aircraft purposefully dropped a huge bomb on the Drama Theater in the city center. Hundreds of people were hiding from the shelling there... The building was destroyed. The death toll is still unknown. Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people. To our Mariupol. To the Donetsk region... Citizens of Russia! How is your blockade of Mariupol different from the blockade of Leningrad during World War II? Who do you inherit? We will not forget anyone whose lives were taken by the occupiers. We will not forgive any murdered soul. Eternal memory to all victims of this terror! To all the victims of the war unleashed by the Russian state. What else do the occupiers have to do, how many more people do they have to kill in order for Western leaders, NATO leaders to respond positively to Ukraine's request for a no-fly zone or for providing our country with the aircraft we so desperately need? I spoke about this today in a speech to the United States Congress. Ukraine has received strong support from our American friends. And I'm grateful to President Biden for that. I am grateful for the leadership that has united the democratic world. But the war does not end. Russia's war crimes do not stop. The Russian economy is still able to maintain their military machine. That is why new packages of sanctions against Russia are needed. The world must finally officially recognize that Russia has become a terrorist state. And most importantly, Ukraine needs to get more support. Even more than we get now. Air defense systems. Aircraft. Enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers. It was in this speech in Congress that I addressed both the United States and all the relevant states as regards creating a new U-24 union. A new alliance that will ensure that each aggressor receives a coordinated response from the world. Fast and efficient. Immediately. Not in weeks, months, years, but in the first 24 hours after the attack. We can no longer trust the existing institutions. We cannot expect bureaucrats in international organizations to change so quickly. Therefore, we must look for new guarantees. Create new tools. Take those who have courage and do what justice requires. We have already proved that we can do historical things. This is not just our resistance. Not just defense. Even at this time - the biggest test for Ukraine - we managed to join the European energy network. Now Ukraine can use electricity flows from the European Union. We have been moving towards this for decades. It finally happened! I am grateful to all the power engineers of our country, to all those who worked for this result. We are already working on programs to restore our country after the war. I promise everyone, every Ukrainian who has lost home, who has lost an apartment as a result of hostilities or shelling that the state will restore everything. Restore independently. I am confident that we will be able to rebuild our state quickly. Whatever the damage may be... It will be a historic reconstruction. A project that will inspire the world just as our struggle for our freedom. Just as our struggle for our Ukraine. During the day I spoke with friends of Ukraine - President of Turkey Erdoğan and Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau. I thanked them for their support. We agreed on new steps for the sake of peace for our country. In a conversation with the Prime Minister of Ireland, I expressed condolences over the murder by the Russian military of an Irish citizen - journalist Pierre Zakrzewski. I also spoke with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. We agreed on the support for our citizens - temporary displaced persons. I will address the German Parliament on Thursday morning. I will continue to fight for even greater support for Ukraine, for even greater pressure on Russia. For the sake of our common victory, for the sake of peace for us. For the sake of peace for us, the Ukrainian delegation speaks with the Russian delegation. And I want all our citizens, citizens of Ukraine, to hear me now. Negotiations are ongoing. Negotiations for the sake of Ukraine. My priorities in the negotiations are absolutely clear: the end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country.

0,"Members of Congress, Ladies and Gentlemen, Americans! Friends! I am proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our capital - Kyiv. From a city that is under missile and air strikes by Russian troops. Daily. But it does not give up. And it didn't even think to give up for a single minute! Just as dozens of other cities and communities in our country, which found themselves in the worst war since World War II. I have the honor to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, brave and freedom-loving people. For eight years they have been resisting the aggression of the Russian Federation. They sacrifice the best children - sons and daughters to stop the full-scale Russian invasion. Now the fate of our state is being decided. The fate of our people. It is being decided whether Ukrainians will be free. Whether they will preserve their democracy. Russia has attacked more than just our land and our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our values. Basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom. Against our right to live freely in our country, choosing our own future. Against our desire for happiness. Against our national dreams. Just like yours, ordinary people of America. Just like those of everyone in the United States. I remember your Rushmore National Memorial. The faces of your prominent presidents. Those who laid the foundations of America. As it is today. Democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone. Everyone who works diligently. Who lives honestly. Who respects the law. We in Ukraine want the same for ourselves. All that is a normal part of life for you. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! In your great history you have pages that will allow you to understand Ukrainians. Understand us now. When it is needed most. Remember Pearl Harbor. Terrible morning of December 7, 1941. When your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember that. Remember September 11th. A terrible day in 2001, when evil tried to turn your cities into a battlefield. When innocent people were attacked. Attacked from the air. In a way no one expected. In a way you could not stop it. Our state experiences this every day! Every night! For three weeks now! Different Ukrainian cities... Odesa and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, Zhytomyr and Lviv, Mariupol and Dnipro. Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death. For thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly a thousand missiles at Ukraine. Countless bombs. They use drones to kill more precisely. This is a terror Europe has not seen for 80 years! And we ask for a response. For the response from the world. For the response to terror. Is this too much of a request? To establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine is to save people. Humanitarian no-fly zone. Conditions under which Russia will no longer be able to terrorize our peaceful cities every day and night. If that's too much, we offer an alternative. You know what defense systems we need. C-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield on the ability to use aircraft. Powerful, strong aircraft. To protect your people. Your freedom. Your land. Aircraft that can help Ukraine. That can help Europe. And you also know that they are available. But on land. Not in the Ukrainian sky. They do not protect our people. ""I have a dream"" - these words are known to each of you. Today I can say: I have a necessity. The necessity to protect our sky. The necessity for your decision. Your help. And it will mean exactly the same thing. The same thing you feel. When you hear: I have a dream. Ladies and Gentlemen! Friends! Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support. For all that your state and your people have already done for our freedom. For weapons and ammunition, for training and funding, for leadership in the free world, which helps put pressure on the aggressor economically. I am grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy around the world. I am grateful to you for the resolution, which recognizes all those who commit crimes against the Ukrainian people as war criminals. However, now, in the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I urge you to do more! New packages of sanctions are needed every week. Until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed as regards everyone on whom this unjust regime is based. We offer the United States to impose sanctions against all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in office and do not sever ties with those responsible for the aggression against Ukraine. From State Duma deputies to the last official who lacks the morale to sever ties with state terror. All American companies must leave Russia, their market. Leave this market flooded with our blood. Ladies and Gentlemen. Members of Congress! Take the lead! If you have companies in the constituencies that sponsor the Russian military machine, keeping their business in Russia... You have to put pressure. So that the Russian state does not receive a single dollar, which it spends on the destruction of Ukraine. On the destruction of Europe. All American ports must be closed to Russian goods and ships. Peace is more important than profit. And we must defend this principle throughout the world together. We have already become part of the anti-war coalition. The great anti-war coalition, which unites many states, dozens of states. Those who reacted in a principled manner to President Putin's decision - to Russia's invasion of our state. But we have to move on. We have to create new tools. To respond quickly! And stop the war. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24. And it would be fair if it ended in a day. In 24 hours. So that evil is punished immediately. Today the world does not have such tools. The wars of the past have prompted our predecessors to create institutions that were supposed to protect us from war. But... They don't work. We see it. You see it. So, we need new ones. New institutions. New alliances. And we offer them. We offer to create an association - U-24. United for peace. A union of responsible states that have the strength and conscience to stop conflicts. Immediately. Provide all necessary assistance in 24 hours. If necessary - weapons. If necessary - sanctions. Humanitarian support. Political support. Funding. Everything necessary to preserve peace quickly. To save lives. In addition, such an association could provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters. Who fell victim to a humanitarian crisis or epidemic. Remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest thing - to give everyone vaccines. Vaccines against Covid. To save lives. To prevent new strains. The world spent months and years doing things that could have been done much faster. So that there were no human losses. Ladies and Gentlemen! Americans! If such an alliance, the U-24, had already been formed, I believe it would have saved thousands of lives. In our country, many other countries that need peace so crucially, that suffered inhuman destruction... I ask you to watch one video now. Video of what Russian troops did on our land. We have to stop this. We must prevent such things. Preventively destroy every aggressor who seeks to conquer another nation. Please watch... And in the end to sum it up. Today it is not enough to be the leader of the nation. Today it takes to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace.    Peace in your country does not depend anymore only on you and your people. It depends on those next to you, on those who are strong. Strong does not mean big. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the life of his citizens and citizens of the world. For human rights, for freedom, for the right to live decently and to die when your time comes, not when it is wanted by someone else, by your neighbor.        Today the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the Future. That’s why today the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe and the world to keep the planet alive, to keep justice in history. Now I am almost 45 years old. Today my age stopped when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life if it cannot stop death. And this is my main mission as the Leader of my people – great Ukrainians. And as the Leader of my nation I am addressing President Biden.   You are the Leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the Leader of the world. Being the Leader of the world means to be the Leader of Peace. Thank you. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Our defenders! We are stepping up work to bring the invaders to justice. There must be an international tribunal. And it will be. For everything they did against Ukraine. Against our people. For every act of terrorism of Russian troops on the territory of our state. The Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies have already started this work. The launch of the activity of the investigative group of the International Criminal Court in Ukraine is also important, which together with our law enforcement officers is already collecting all the evidence, collecting the facts of war crimes of the invaders on the territory of our state. So that they receive the legal answer - legal and concrete. I spoke with Karim Khan, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He is already in Ukraine, he has already started working. Therefore, the invaders will be responsible for all war crimes against Ukrainians. Last night, Russian troops continued shelling Ukrainian territory, our peaceful cities, our citizens. Kharkiv and the region... They bombed the coast of the Odesa region. They fired missiles at Kyiv. Hit civilian infrastructure of Zaporizhzhia. As of this morning, 103 children have been killed. Russian troops have now inflicted hundreds of times more damage on Ukraine than on Donbas in eight years of war. And the territories of Donbas, border regions in the Russian direction, Kyiv region and the south of Ukraine suffered the most. The most affected areas are those that Russian propagandists have always spoken of as the place of residence of people especially close to Russia. Apparently, there are no non-nuclear weapons that the invaders have not yet used against our civilians. That's their closeness. That’s their friendship. That’s, as they said in Moscow, ""a divided nation."" A total of 400 educational institutions have been destroyed in Ukraine to date, the largest number is in the Donetsk region - 119. In Mariupol, the invaders seized a hospital, a regional intensive care hospital. Already damaged by Russian bombs. Patients and doctors are in captivity. Residents of neighboring houses were forced to go inside the hospital as well. More than 400 people are hostages! And the invaders are using the hospital as a firing position to shell the city. This regular crime of the Russian military against Mariupol is no different from Basayev's seizure of the hospital in Budyonnovsk. Although... It is different. Now it's even more treacherous. Last night, the invaders took hostage six people in the Bucha City Council. A Ukrainian rescuer who was captured in an agreed humanitarian corridor is being held hostage! The mayors of several of our cities, activists, a journalist are being held hostage... The Russian state has become an outspoken terrorist. And it is not ashamed. But it will be responsible for everything. The world is already beginning to understand that without the recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, it will be impossible to restore justice for Ukraine, it will be impossible to restore international order. Today I signed an important decree on a nationwide minute of silence to honor the memory of all Ukrainians who died in our patriotic war. All those we lost because of the Russian invasion. Because of the terror committed by the invaders . Every morning at 9 am in the whole territory of our state we will remember the Ukrainians who gave their lives. All who fought. All military and all civilians. Adults and children... Everyone! All those who could still be alive if Russia had not started this war. May the memory of everyone who died for Ukraine live forever! The losses of the invaders continue to grow. The number of killed enemy soldiers is already approaching 14,000. Tens of thousands of Russian servicemen were wounded. They have already lost more than a hundred helicopters. Soon there will be hundreds of lost planes. More than 400 Russian tanks were destroyed, plus several thousand units of other equipment. We take abandoned enemy equipment from the battlefield and use it to protect our state and our people. Ukrainians! If you know where the enemy is and where he abandoned his tanks or other armored vehicles, ordnance, inform the Ukrainian forces. Let's use everything for our victory! And for the sake of victory be wise. Don't publish details of our air defense work when you hear the guys work. Do not publish maps that you find in abandoned Russian vehicles and in the broken command posts of the invaders. Please give them to our military. Let them use it to make the enemy suffer! Today at 3 pm Kyiv time I will address the Congress of the United States of America. This will be an important speech. A speech from all of us, from each of our defenders, from each of our citizens. Addressed to the most powerful democracy in the world. To the state and the people who can do a lot to stop Russian aggression, to restore peace on our land. Eight years ago, on this day, the Russian state organized a fake ""referendum"" on the territory of our Ukrainian Crimea. Which it later used to justify the seizure of our territory. It was illegal. This was the destruction of the entire security architecture in Europe, which was created after World War II. But Russia went for it. If then there had been at least a hint of such resistance, which we are showing now, which you are showing now... If then the world had reacted at least half as it should react now and reacts... I'm sure we would have had neither this invasion, nor eight years of war in Donbas. All this evil was born from the occupation of Crimea. From our weakness, the brutal actions of Russia, for which it should have been punished already in 2014. We are much stronger now, we are united. Now we are a great nation. But... We don't have a time machine and we can't go back to the moment when everything was decided. We can and must fight today, now. We can and must protect our state, our Ukrainian life. We can and must hold negotiations on a just and fair peace for Ukraine. On the real security guarantees that will work. This is an ambitious task. A difficult one. This is a long way. But I am sure that we, Ukrainians, can do all this. We, Ukrainians, can win. And return to peace. To the peace we all so strive for. Glory to our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Free people of a free country! Eight years of war in Donbas, 20 days of full-scale invasion. The third week is about to be over. We all want peace. As soon as possible. We all want to win. And there is always a feeling that a little more, and we will get what belongs to us, Ukraine, by right. But... But efforts are still needed. It takes patience. We still have to fight. And work - everyone in their place. Everyone. In particular, our representatives, our delegation in negotiations with the Russian Federation. It is important. It is difficult, but important, because any war ends in an agreement. Meetings continue. As I am told, the positions in the negotiations sound more realistic. However, time is still needed for the decisions to be in Ukraine's interests. Our heroes, our defenders give us this time. Defending Ukraine everywhere. Wherever the enemy wants to break through. The invaders did not succeed today. Although thousands of their people were thrown into battle. In the north and east, in the south of our state. The enemy lost equipment, hundreds of soldiers... Many Russian conscripts died. Dozens of officers. One more general is among the killed invaders. At least one general today. The invaders also committed new and obvious war crimes. They fired at peaceful cities and civilian infrastructure. The number of missiles that Russia has used against Ukraine already exceeds 900. There are so many air bombs that it is impossible to count them. Two more journalists were killed in an artillery strike by Russian troops. Ukrainian Oleksandra Kuvshynova and Fox News representative Pierre Zakrzewski. Another journalist was heavily wounded. The shelling took place in the Kyiv region. And this is another big reason to tighten Western sanctions against the Russian Federation. Tighten until the Russian state stops the war. Citizens of Russia! Any of you who have access to truthful information could already understand how this war will end for your country. Shame and poverty. Years of isolation. A very cruel repressive system that will treat the citizens of Russia in the same inhumane way as you, invaders, treated Ukrainians. What happens next depends on your actions. I want to speak directly to all the officials of the Russian Federation, to everyone who is related to the current government: if you remain in office, if you do not oppose the war, the international community will deprive you of everything. Everything you have earned over the years. This is already being done. The same goes for the propaganda system. The fourth branch of power in Russia. If you stay to work for propaganda, you are putting yourself at much greater risk than if you just leave. Just quit. The risk of sanctions and an international tribunal for propaganda of an aggressive war, for justifying war crimes. Quit! A few months without a job is definitely better for you than a lifetime of international persecution. Today the Prime Ministers of the three partner states and the three friendly states of Ukraine visited Kyiv. Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Poland was also represented by Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński and the Prime Minister of Poland. I was glad to meet, to talk directly, in person, in our capital. This is important support. When our Kyiv is a target for the invaders, it is especially important and especially courageous to be here, next to us, next to friends. This is how leadership is shown. And I invite all friends of Ukraine to visit Kyiv. It can be dangerous here. It is true. Because our sky is not yet closed to Russian missiles and planes. The decision to strengthen our arsenal in the air has not yet been made. We have not received planes. But... You know for sure that the eyes of all the people of the world are now focused on our capital, on Ukrainians. So everyone who is with us will receive gratitude. Not only ours, but also of other nations of the world. Everyone who is with us has a chance to become a real hero. I addressed the Canadian Parliament. In fact, in front of the entire political community of this country - our friend. In front of all Canadians. I thanked them for their support - really sincere support. Canada was among the first to come to the rescue of Ukraine. And I called on Canadians to maintain that leadership. Help Ukraine. Not in words, but in deeds: weapons, new sanctions against Russia. As well as an active moral position. A position as regards all international businesses that still stay in Russia, that do not leave. Although they fully understand that they are sponsoring the war, sponsoring terror. My address to the United States Congress is scheduled for Wednesday. An important event. And today I would like to thank President Biden and all the friends of Ukraine in the United States for the new $13.6 billion package of support for our country, our people. The law providing for this funding has been signed. We consider it as the first step towards the full restoration of Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada also met today. The meeting was effective. Economic innovations have been approved - tax cuts that should save jobs and allow Ukraine's business to work. Wherever possible. There is a zero rate of excise duty and 7% VAT on fuel to stabilize prices and ensure supply. Business regulation is simplified as much as possible. We are reducing the activities of control bodies so that there are no unnecessary inspections for those who work in accordance with Ukrainian law and do not violate consumer rights. The new law also provides the necessary guarantees for the territorial defense warriors - all volunteers will be recognized as combat veterans. A technical decision was made to continue martial law. This is needed to effectively defend the state. Also all nuances of police activity during martial law are settled. I am waiting for the adopted laws to sign them. And I am grateful to the people's deputies of Ukraine for the fact that the majority of votes collected more than 340 votes in favor. This demonstrates the political unity of Ukraine. Finally. When all parties and groups work together in a legitimately elected parliament, one of the main myths of the invaders that the Ukrainian government allegedly does not represent the will of the people is shattered. It definitely does! And all the collaborators who decided to work a little for the invaders must already think where in Rostov they will hide from punishment. I hope that on Wednesday the long-awaited rescue of people from the city of Izyum, Kharkiv region, will take place. The humanitarian corridor has been agreed upon. Over the past 24 hours, 28,893 Ukrainians were rescued from combat areas in Sumy, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. 20,000 of them managed to leave Mariupol. So far only by personal vehicles. There will be a difficult situation. We are fighting for you. Sorry, everything is very difficult. The Ukrainian humanitarian convoy is still constantly blocked by Russian soldiers on the way to the city. But we will not give up trying to save people, to save the city. And I am grateful to each of our defenders! To every defender of Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Mykolaiv and all other cities this evil wants to capture. I am grateful to all who hold on and fight for life. Your resistance, your resilience, your courage make it possible for Ukraine to survive. And save our people and our land. I signed a decree on awarding state awards to 139 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who distinguished themselves in the defense of our state. 32 of them - posthumously. I also signed a decree on conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star to: Colonel Hudz Valeriy Fedorovych. Posthumously. For the heroic defense of Popasna in the Luhansk region. Colonel Kotenko Serhiy Leonidovych. Posthumously. Thanks to his courageous actions and personal determination, several columns of enemy equipment were destroyed. Colonel Maryniak Oleksandr Myroslavovych. Posthumously. Due to his determination, a large number of enemy soldiers, groups of fuel tanks and enemy equipment were destroyed during the defense of the Kyiv region. Major Sbytov Pavlo Olehovych. Posthumously. Thanks to his professionalism and decisive actions, the destruction of several large enemy units was organized. May the memory of everyone who died for our Ukraine live forever! On conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star to: Senior Lieutenant Dozirchy Dmytro Leonidovych. His effective actions in the defense of the Kherson region allowed our forces to get out of the encirclement and continue the struggle. Senior Lieutenant Sydunets Volodymyr Volodymyrovych. Thanks to his actions, the division of the Russian Iskanders was destroyed. Glory to all of you! Glory to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Dear speakers! Members of the government and parliament! Dear attendees, Dear friends! Before I begin, I want you to understand my feelings, the feelings of Ukrainians. As much as possible. Feelings during these 20 days. 20 days of full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation after eight years of war in Donbas. Just imagine... Imagine that at four in the morning each of you hears explosions. Terrible explosions. Justin, imagine that you hear it. And your children hear it. Hear missile strikes at Ottawa airport. At dozens of other places throughout your beautiful country, Canada. Cruise missiles. Even before dawn. And your children hug you and ask: “what happened, dad?” And you are already receiving the first reports on which facilities in your country have been destroyed by missiles of the Russian Federation. And you know how many people have already died and where. Imagine you are looking for words to explain this to children. Explain to them that a large-scale war has begun. The war aimed at the destruction of your state, at the conquest of your people. And you know it. The second day - and you get a message about the columns of armored vehicles. Thousands, thousands coming to your land. First - small cities, then larger ones. They want to block them all. And they do so. They approach Edmonton - imagine - and fire artillery. Fire at residential areas, at people. Schools are being burned down, kindergartens are being blown up. Just as in our cities - in Sumy, in our Okhtyrka. They blockade Vancouver and besiege hundreds of thousands of people who remain in the city. As in our Mariupol. For the second week under fire, without electricity completely, almost without food, definitely without water. In the basements. Justin! Dear attendees! Gentlemen! Imagine hearing the report on the dead every day. Yes, you are the president or the head of government, but you just hear about it, about the dead children. And the death toll is growing. 97 children were killed as of this morning. The famous CN Tower in Toronto... How many Russian missiles will be enough to destroy it? Believe me, I do not wish this to all of you... But we predict every day how many more missiles can hit our TV towers. And they hit them. Our Freedom Square in Kharkiv and your Churchill Square in Edmonton. Imagine Russian missiles hitting its heart. Our Babyn Yar is the burial place of the Holocaust victims... The Russians did not stop before bombing even this land. And what about the National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa? Will it withstand the impact of three or five missiles? It happened to us. Air bombs. A minute ago there were people alive. There was a family that just came there. They were alive. And now... You understand. And then a terrible night... each of these 20, when the Russian militaries fire from tanks at housing estates. From tanks - at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Direct guidance. When the fire started there. Can you imagine that happening to your Bruce Station in Ontario? And what would you feel if you saw your flag in every city where they pass, how your flag in Montreal is removed... Removed to be thrown away and replaced with a Russian one. I know that you support Ukraine, sincerely, effectively. We are friends with Justin. But I want you to understand me, and to feel it. Feel what we feel. Feel how we want to live. And how we want to win. Win for life. I want you to feel what it's like when you call your friends and say: close the sky, stop the shelling. No matter which way, just do it. Stop the bombing. How many more missiles must fall on our cities? And in response you hear that someone does not want to do it ... But they are deeply concerned! Then give us planes, we tell our partners. They answer: Soon. Be patient a little. Everyone is deeply concerned. They just don't want to. And someone is looking for reasons. The main thing is the result. They talk about escalation. How can it get worse? They say Ukraine is not in NATO now. Although ""the door is open"". But for whom are these doors and where do they lead, if we are told that we will not be admitted. War always shows everything people are capable of. Who is strong. And who is weak. Who is wise. Who does not see the obvious. Who is honest and who is a hypocrite. And we saw it all. And we understood all this. In 20 days and eight years. I'm sure you've seen it all. Dear speakers! Members of the government. Members of parliament! Dear friends! Canada has always been, is and, I am sure, will be a reliable partner in Ukraine. Partner of our land, our people of Ukraine, each of our families. You came to our aid as soon as we asked for it. You are giving us the weapons and other support we so desperately need now. You have imposed sanctions against Russia - truly moral. Really substantial. However, we see that the war, unfortunately, continues. That Russian troops are not leaving our territory. You see that our cities: Kharkiv, Mariupol are not as protected as your Edmonton and Vancouver. That Kyiv is under missile strikes. Like Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Ivano-Frankivsk and dozens, dozens of our Ukrainian cities that yesterday were peaceful and quiet. That means more needs to be done. Much more! For peace. We all have to do more to stop Russia. To protect Ukraine and protect Europe from this total evil that is destroying everything: memorials, churches, schools, hospitals, neighborhoods and all our businesses. They have already killed 97 Ukrainian children! We do not ask for much. We ask for justice. We ask for real support that will help us endure and defend our life. Life of the whole world. Canada is already showing the necessary leadership! It is already the first to do what other countries come to later. But we need more leadership, and we ask for more participation from you. Justin! All friends of our country Ukraine! All friends of the truth! You understand how important it is for us to protect our skies from Russian missiles and planes. You can influence this. It seems so to me. You can force even more companies to leave the Russian market. So that there is not a single dollar for the war. If they stay in Russia and sponsor the war, they are not allowed to work in Canada. Let it be so - and it will give us peace. You know, perhaps better than many in the world, that this attack by Russia is an attempt to destroy us, to destroy the Ukrainian people. Nothing else. This is their main goal. This is a war against the people. Against our people. This is a war to destroy everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainians. Against our future. Against our character. Against our will. Everything that you, Canadians, know very well, feel very well. So I ask you: do not stop. Do not stop helping Ukraine. Do not stop in leadership and in efforts to bring peace back to our peaceful land. I believe, I know you can handle it. I know that with Canada, our anti-war coalition, which we are reinforcing, will definitely yield the result. I want to address our Ukrainian diaspora, all Ukrainians in Canada. It is at this historic moment that we need your effective help. And you must prove with your steps that you are a part of the history of Ukraine, the living history of Ukraine. Remember this - living. Because we want to live. And we strive for peace. I thank you for your support. I am thankful to everyone present in this hall of parliament. To every citizen of Canada. I'm grateful to you, Justin. Grateful on behalf of the entire Ukrainian nation. I am sure that together - and only together - we will defeat all enemies. Glory to Ukraine! Thank you Canada!

0,"Strong people of our indomitable country! Eight years of war against us. The 20th day of full-scale invasion. Attempts to destroy us all, to destroy Ukraine. We are fighting for our lives. We are fighting for our lives against missiles, bombs, artillery, tanks, mortars and everything else that Russian troops are using to destroy us. Everything else that Russia is destroying itself with now. Because every shot at Ukraine, every blow at Ukraine are steps towards Russia's self-destruction. Steps to self-isolation, poverty and degradation. Everyone who just wants to live and has something to think with is leaving Russia. Scientists, artists, businessmen, IT specialists, etc. The Russian state has not experienced such a blow at human capital for decades. A blow, which it inflicted on itself. We do not care. This is not our problem. Our problem is to save our people. The strength of our society. Its scientists, its artists, its businessmen, its people, its strong people. All our Ukrainians who defend the state and bring closer the peace that every Ukrainian needs. Last night there were air alarms almost all over our country. The airport in Dnipro was destroyed by a missile strike. Kharkiv. Russian bombs hit residential areas. Artillery. Mortars. Fighting continues in the region - Izyum, Chuhuiv. Disassembly of wreckage in Rivne after the missile strike on the TV tower is ongoing. As of now, 19 casualties are confirmed. Ancient Chernihiv and Oster are under such a brutal attack by Russia that it has wiped out any claims to its cultural ties to the times of Rus’. The invaders have no roots, no memory and no soul. Russian troops attacked Kyiv, attacked Kyiv residents. Four apartment buildings were destroyed. Disassembly of the debris is still ongoing. As of now, five casualties are confirmed. I will tell you in Russian: this happened in our capital. In the city that you always called “the mother of Russian cities”. That made our nations historical. And that you bombed today. Just people, residential areas. Bombed and bombed again. We don't need such children. No, thanks. The invaders continue to consider the capture of our capital as their key goal, their political goal. They hope that control over Kyiv will give them control over Ukraine. This is absolute absurdity from all points of view. To further strengthen the defense of the capital and the Kyiv region, I appointed Hero of Ukraine, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Joint Forces Operation Oleksandr Pavliuk head of the regional military administration. Dismissed head of the regional administration Oleksiy Kuleba will help the military leadership. Therefore, the Kyiv direction and the situation in the region will get even more attention. Major General Eduard Moskaliov became the new commander of the Joint Forces. Professional man, patriotic man. The decree is signed. Every morning, every evening, I thank the military. I thank all our heroes who bravely defend our state. All who stop the enemy despite the fact that the invaders are many times more. Dozens of times. And now, today, I want to speak about all peaceful Ukrainians who were taken away by this war. Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Eternal curse to the enemy who took thousands of lives. Humanitarian corridors have been partially opened today. There is a corridor from Sumy, Trostyanets, Lebedyn, Shostka and Konotop in the direction of Poltava. The invaders did not stop the shelling and disrupted humanitarian corridors in the Kyiv region. The convoy with humanitarian cargo for Mariupol also remains blocked. For several days in a row. But still little by little people are leaving the besieged city by private transport. I want to thank SES officers, police, doctors and everyone else who saves people for this important work. And of course, I am thankful to our military. Today I spoke at the summit organized by Great Britain, a friend of Ukraine - Boris Johnson. I addressed the United Kingdom Joint Expeditionary Force. Spoke to the leaders of the Baltic states and the countries of northern Europe. I said what, of course, all our citizens would like to say. About NATO. About help. About sincerity and... the fact that not everyone took a moral stance in response to the Russian war. Each of more than 800 Russian missiles that have hit our country is an answer to a long-standing question about NATO. Whether the doors of the Alliance are really open for Ukraine. If they were open, if it was fair, we would not have to convince the Alliance for 20 days that the sky over Ukraine should be closed. Closed to the death brought by the Russian Air Force. But... They don't hear or don't want to hear us yet. Some Allies have intimidated themselves. Saying that they allegedly can't answer. They cannot collide with Russian missiles and planes in the sky of Ukraine. Because this, they say, will lead to escalation, will lead to World War III... And what will they say if Russia goes further into Europe, attacking other countries? I'm sure it's the same thing they say to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO treaty has never been as weak as it is now. This is just our opinion. When some members of the Alliance are afraid to be truly an alliance capable of protecting everything for which it was created. Freedom and democracy. Humanity and justice. We need to look for effective guarantees. Guarantees for us, for our sky. And we will not give up. We need planes. And I will continue to talk about it, I will continue to pursue it. We need long-term security guarantees for the state. For all Ukrainians. Concrete things. Concrete guarantees. Legally enshrined. So that there is no doubt in them. And so that no excuses sound. As they sound now, when we turn to those who signed ""Budapest"" and who... had the power to stop the Russian invasion even before it began. Using preventive measures. By helping Ukraine, which is convincing. Using sanctions that do not allow war. Ukrainians! There are more than 40 million of us in our state. And millions more around the world. This is a great force. Plus our friends. Plus many of our partner countries. We all now have a common task, a national task. We must put pressure on Russia so that the price for this war against Ukraine becomes extremely painful. So that everyone in the world takes a moral stance. Not only states, but also companies. I'm talking about business. Large corporations that still sponsor Russia's military machine and have not left the Russian market, although they should have done so immediately. As soon as the world saw what Russian troops were doing on our Ukrainian land. You know these brands. They are well known. And there are no secrets here. Nestle, Mondelēz and other giants of the food industry. As well as Raiffeisen, Societe Generale and other banks. BASF, Samsung and LG. Bayer, Sanofi and other pharma companies. Unilever, Johnson & Johnson... And dozens of other companies. And that's billions of dollars. We turn to the world. To states and to people. But this is not just the work of politicians. I appeal to Ukrainians. To everyone and in any country. Where you can influence it. Everything is in your power. All business with Russia must be stopped. All trade operations. So that they can't sponsor the killings. Killings of us and our children. So that dollars and euros are not paid for blood. Please contact politicians. Put pressure. Talk to reporters. Boycott their products. They must feel our strength! They must feel your strength! Because we have the strength. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Free people of a free country! The 19th day of our resistance is over. Historical war. Another difficult day, which is still approaching our victory. Approaching peace for Ukraine. As before, the enemy is confused. They did not expect such resistance. They believed in their propaganda, which has been lying about us for decades.They still can't recollect themselves. But they have already begun to understand that they will not achieve anything by war. Their soldiers know this. Their officers are aware of this. They flee the battlefield. They abandon equipment. We take trophies and use them to protect Ukraine. Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army. They could not imagine such a thing in a nightmare. And I want to tell the Russian soldiers. Those who have already entered our land. And who are just about to be sent to fight against us. Russian conscripts! Listen to me very carefully. Russian officers! You’ve already understood everything. You will not take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives. There are a lot of you. But your life will also be taken. But why should you die? What for? I know that you want to survive. We hear your conversations in the intercepts, we hear what you really think about this senseless war, about this disgrace and about your state. Your conversations with each other. Your calls home to your family. We hear it all. We draw conclusions. We know who you are. Therefore, I offer you a choice. On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way you were not treated in your army. And in a way your army does not treat ours. Choose! Our brave defenders continue to inflict devastating losses on Russian troops. Soon the number of downed helicopters of Russia will reach hundreds of units. They have already lost 80 warplanes. Hundreds of tanks and thousands of other units of equipment. In 19 days, the Russian army has lost more in Ukraine than in two bloody and years-long wars in Chechnya. For what? I am grateful to those Russians who do not stop trying to convey the truth. To those who fight disinformation and tell the truth, real facts to their friends and loved ones. And personally to the woman who entered the studio of Channel One with a poster against the war. To those who are not afraid to protest. As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight. You must not lose your chance. The European Union has approved the fourth package of sanctions against Russia. The fourth - and I'm sure not the last. We are working with partners on new restrictions that will be applied against the Russian state. Everyone who is responsible for the war. Everyone who is responsible for the destruction of democracy. Everyone who is responsible for repression against people. Everyone will get an answer. The answer of the world. And this is just the beginning. Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable. Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable. The whole world sees what is happening in Mariupol. Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Sumy. Okhtyrka. Hostomel. Irpin. In all our cities. All our partners are informed of the crimes of the invaders against civilians and local self-government in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. In the temporarily occupied areas. There will be an answer for that. Necessarily. For the disrupted humanitarian corridors. Necessarily. During the day of March 14, 3,806 Ukrainians were evacuated from the cities and towns of the Kyiv and Luhansk regions.  Our convoy with one hundred tons of what is most necessary for Mariupol is still kept in Berdyansk. For three days already. But we will try. We will do everything to ensure that Mariupol residents receive food, water and medicine. I provided full information about the actions of the invaders on the Ukrainian land in conversations with friends and partners of our state. Every aggressive action of the invaders only pushes the world to new sanctions. I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. With President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel. We have 100% mutual understanding. The conversation with Prime Minister of Israel Bennett was also important. As part of a negotiation effort to end this war as soon as possible. With a fair peace. Our delegation also worked on this in negotiations with the Russian party. Pretty good, as I was told. But let's see. They will continue tomorrow. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has agreed on a package of decisions to support our economy. So that business works. So that people have jobs. Where security allows. Where people are ready for it. First, we are starting tax reform. Instead of VAT and income tax we give a rate of 2 percent of turnover and simplified accounting. For small businesses - this is the first and second group of sole proprietors - we set a voluntary payment of a single tax. That is, if you can - pay. You can't - no questions asked. The second is maximum business deregulation. We cancel all inspections for all businesses. So that everyone works normally. So that the cities come to life. So that life continues wherever there is no hostilities. The only condition is that you ensure the normal operation of your business in the framework of Ukrainian law. These are just the first two steps of our tax reform. To be continued. And finally. I have just signed a decree on awarding state awards of Ukraine to 234 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who showed personal courage and heroism in the fight for our land. For our independence. 59 of them posthumously. May the memory of everyone who gave life for our state live forever! Eternal gratitude to all our heroes! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"I wish you health, dear Ukrainians! Good weather, which we now almost do not notice. Clear sky... There is no such thing over Kyiv today. Over Kyiv and other cities of our state. Due to missile strikes, traces of enemy aircraft. The streets are quiet, but I know, I believe it's not for long. Not forever. That's why we work. That is why we fight. That's why we don't give what’s ours. Today we celebrate our purely Ukrainian holiday. Volunteer Day. It is our ability to instantly unite during ordeals, find common ground and fight together that creates our character, Ukrainian character. We may not notice each other in everyday life. Agree, this happens to us. But when we see a threat to our way of life, to our spirit, when we see a threat to Ukraine, our state, we do not hesitate even for a moment. If we are Ukrainians. We unite. We do everything to protect what’s ours. Ukrainians do not need to be persuaded to become volunteers. Ukrainians do not need to be encouraged to start helping each other. Strong support for the Armed Forces by all the people of Ukraine, sincere volunteer movement, mass joining the territorial defense, solidarity of all our people - these are the prerequisites for victory. Prerequisites for the liberation of our entire country... The only and the best. For us, Ukraine is not just a territory, as for the invaders. They do not distinguish anything here. They do not understand anything. That is why for them everything is just a target. For us, Ukraine is millions of happy moments, native symbols, memorable places. We feel this land. For us, Ukraine is our life, and that is why millions of people have come to the defense of our state today. That is why today we are all volunteers. All those who defend Ukraine, our children, those who defend our future. To all who feel this free call... A call to defend Ukraine... Who are volunteers in battles. Or in the information troops. Who protects roads and cities. All diplomats - official and informal. Everyone who helps with technology. Who keeps the business. Who supplies the necessary goods, products. Who saves and heals under any circumstances. Who works in transport. Who provides communication and repairs networks... I am grateful to everyone. And I sincerely congratulate you! Each of the volunteers. Each of the millions working together to win. The 19th day of our resistance. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are holding on bravely. And creatively. We inflict such losses on the enemy that he no longer knows where else to look for reserves. Where else to look for help. Help for himself. Help for the invader. This is pathetic. But we have no right to relax. The Russian state has been preparing for war for decades. They have accumulated significant military resources. For the evil. For the conquest of neighbors. And for the destruction of Ukraine, Europe, as we know it, as we value it. That's why we have to hold on. We have to fight. To win. To come to the peace deserved by Ukrainians. Fair peace. With security guarantees for our state. For our people. And to put it on paper. In negotiations. Difficult negotiations. The video meeting of the delegations has already started today. It continues. Everyone is waiting for the news. We will definitely report in the evening. As long as the state is at war, as long as the people are defending themselves, the economy must be preserved and restored. As much as possible in the current difficult conditions. Life must appear on the streets of the cities. Where security allows. Where people can provide it. Pharmacies, trade, any business that can work. For the country to live. For the restoration of Ukraine to already begin. And it depends on each of us, on each of us who is able to work. Economic suppression of Ukraine is one of the tasks of the war against us. And we have to fight back from that as well. Save our economy. Save our people. Therefore, the government has received a clear instruction - to return small and medium-sized businesses. Remove any obstacles. Reduce taxes as much as possible, remove all difficulties, absolutely all. So that the system does not press, so that people know that they can work the way they can. Where they can. A new tax model is needed for the war and for the post-war development. The financial rules also need to be updated. To make people feel that they can be flexible. Feel that all the money and valuables will be saved. And that you shouldn’t be afraid of losing something, because the state guarantees the security of assets and savings. The Cabinet of Ministers is already working on how to regulate this. A day or two - and there will be details. Ukrainians! Russian troops continue to destroy our infrastructure, continue to destroy our cities. Kyiv region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Kharkiv, south, Donbas. But know - we will rebuild everything. We will restore everything. Every street of every city. Every house, every apartment of every Ukrainian. After the war, I'm sure we can do it quickly. We will direct all our efforts to this. All the help of the world. We are already creating funds for Ukraine to live. But now that the invaders are still on our land, we must beat them as best as we can. Drive them away in any way we can. Defend the cities. Defend the villages. Defend every meter of our land. And every part of our heart. Ukrainian heart. Ukrainian soul. Help each other! Support each other! Support the defense! And protect the state! Together we will definitely win. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Strong people of an unbreakable country! Today is the 18th day. The 18th day of our war for life, for Ukraine, for independence. The beginning of this day was black. Russian missiles and air bombs hit our country again. From east to west. 30 missiles for the Lviv region alone. The shelling of the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security killed 35 people and wounded 134 others. Nothing was happening there that could threaten the territory of the Russian Federation. And only 20 kilometers away are NATO borders. Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war. We were right. I have been saying for a long time that Nord Stream is a weapon that will hit Europe. Now it's obvious. And now I repeat again - if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries. An American journalist was killed in the Kyiv region today. Brent Renaud. His colleague was wounded. It was a deliberate attack by the Russian military. They knew what they were doing. But not everyone in the West seems to know what they are doing. In the east of our country, the invaders decided to ""demilitarize"" and ""denazify"" the Sviatohirsk Lavra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Moscow Patriarchate. At the time of the attack, only monks and hundreds of refugees were on the territory of the monastery. No military target in or near the monastery. But Russian troops do not stop even before striking at the monastery. This fact alone demonstrates that the whole ideology of the Russian state is simply a lie. Today I visited our guys, our defenders who are recovering from wounds at a military hospital. We talked. I presented awards. Orders and medals - for courage, for glory for Ukraine. And I really want my greeting ""I wish you good health"" to work today as powerfully as our Armed Forces have been holding key frontiers. For 18 days already. By the way, the Russian military from Ryazan is being treated in the same hospital. He is in the same ward with our defenders. Gets the same aid. From the same doctors. Despite what this guy was doing. Against us, against Ukraine. But Ukrainian doctors saved him. And this is obvious. Because they are people. Not savages. And we have to go through this war so that we all remain human. I am grateful to all the doctors and nurses who work in Kyiv and Dnipro, in Vinnytsia and Lviv, in Chernihiv and Donbas, in Kharkiv, in Melitopol, in Mariupol... Everyone! Mariupol Military Hospital. Pokrovsk Military Mobile Hospital. Chasiv Yar Military Mobile Hospital. Military Medical Clinical Center of the Eastern Region. Cherkaske Military Hospital. Military Medical Clinical Center of the Central Region, Vinnytsia. Military Medical Clinical Center of the Western Region, Lviv. Military Medical Rehabilitation Center, left Irpen, but continues to work. Sincere gratitude! From all of us. From all Ukrainians. I also visited checkpoints today. I didn't want it to be very public. Just to support our guys. To talk. Courageous men, cheerful guys. Who defend Kyiv and know that WE will win. It is felt. We will win due to our unique ability to unite. We can always care for our people. Ours in spirit, in heart, in sincerity. I met an extraordinary person there at the checkpoint who supports our defenders every day and brings them a pot of borscht every day. Really delicious! Truly Ukrainian. Wholeheartedly. And I know that our state has been based on such people for centuries. It is thanks to such people that we will survive any dark days. Because we are together. And we always protect our own people. And our own property. NOT for money. Without coercion. NOT like those who came to us. Just because we are Ukrainians. Important international negotiations. Bulgaria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, Britain. We feel the support of these countries. We feel the support for our army. It is important. I also spoke with Charles Michel, President of the European Council. About our European perspective, which is becoming a reality. Now about the negotiations with the Russian Federation. Representatives of our countries’ delegations speak in video format every day. Our delegation has a clear task - to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for. Obviously this is a difficult story. A hard path. But this path is needed. And our goal is for Ukraine to get the necessary result in this struggle, in this negotiation work. Necessary for peace. And for security. So that we have guarantees - normal, effective. NOT like the Budapest ones and not like in our sky. So that Ukrainians could say: this is what works. These are the guarantees. It is necessary to talk. More than ten humanitarian corridors worked. Kyiv region, Luhansk region... 5550 people were saved in one day. In six days - more than 130,000. It is necessary to talk. And this is also due to negotiations. We have to understand that. Unfortunately, the humanitarian corridor to Mariupol was blocked. Again. We did everything necessary. Ensured ""silence"". Russian troops disrupted the movement of cargo and buses. But we will try again. Until we can help our people. Because they are ours. Our Mariupol. Heroic Mariupol. Ukrainians! We are going through the worst ordeal in our history. In our lives. We protect the most precious thing we have. We must hold on. We must fight. And we will win. I know that. I believe in that. Glory to you!  Glory to our people! Glory to our heroes!  Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Wise people of a strong country! The 17th day of the war is over. War for the right to be free. For the right to live on our land the way we, Ukrainians, want it. Not the way someone came up with for us. And against us. Against our nature. Against our character. The Russian invaders cannot conquer us. They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror. Only on weapons, which they have a lot. But the invaders have no natural basis for normal life. So that people can feel happy and dream. They are organically incapable of making life normal! Wherever Russia has come to a foreign land, dreams are impossible. Only a very hard struggle for survival. As a result of the attack on our land, on Ukraine, the Russian leadership is actually turning its state into an analogue of the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LPR"". Into a large area isolated from the rest of the world. Where poverty will reign. Where everything will be determined only by violence. And where people will flee. In any manner they can and whoever can. Look who is leaving Russia now. Who withdraws business. These are professionals who can be competitive at the global market. These are IT specialists who do not want to live in an area where there is no freedom. These are businessmen who feel that everything will be taken away from them at any moment. These are artists who know that creativity in a territory where human life is worthless is also worthless. Russia loses its brains. Loses talent. Loses money. But if this is happening to Russia, then what awaits the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LPR""? Their analogues? Solely complete degradation. The invaders in the Kherson region are trying to repeat the notorious experience of the formation of pseudo-republics. Blackmail local leaders, put pressure on deputies. Look for someone to bribe. They’re trying to organize the so-called ""KPR"". Stillborn as ""DPR"" and ""LPR"". To organize some ""committees"" against the legitimate government on our land. And against the will of the people who go out to protest every day. And who want Ukraine. I am grateful to them. I want to tell some figures who lacked the disgust to refuse to talk to the invaders... I want to say - if some of them were suddenly tempted by proposals from the invaders... You sign your sentence. The sentence is to follow more than 12,000 invaders who failed to understand in time why Ukraine should not be encroached upon. An emergency meeting of the Kherson Regional Council took place. 44 deputies decided that the Kherson region is Ukraine, and no pseudo-republics have a place there. Ukraine will stand the test. We need time and strength to break the military machine that came to our land. I will not underestimate the threat. And I will not exaggerate the achievements. We are honest people, not Russia's Ministry of Defense. Which lies to everyone - millions of its citizens and even the head of the Russian Federation. So I say frankly: we still need to hold on. We still have to fight. Every day and every night we must look for ways to cause maximum damage to the enemy. In all areas of defense. Near Zhytomyr and Kyiv, near Chernihiv and Sumy, near Kharkiv and Luhansk, near Donetsk and Mariupol, in the south of the country and on the diplomatic frontline. Having such tactics and having self-confidence, we will regain what’s ours. We will come to Melitopol and Henichesk. We will come wherever our land is. And let the invaders know. Let all the collaborators they find know. That Ukraine will not forgive them. Nobody. Nothing. Ukraine will not forget. Ukraine will find and prosecute. Every single one. In any possible way. By the way, all humanitarian corridors, which were agreed upon, worked. 12,729 people were evacuated. The humanitarian cargo for Mariupol is to arrive tomorrow afternoon. Due to the complexity of the route they had to spend the night in Berdyansk. On every occasion, I constantly repeat to our friends and partners abroad that they should do more for Ukraine, for Ukrainians. Because it is not only for Ukraine. This is for everyone in Europe. Evil that purposefully bombs peaceful cities... Evil that fires even at ambulances and blows up hospitals will not be able to stop at one country. If it has the strength to go further. I said this at a very important rally in support of our people, which was organized in Europe. More than a hundred thousand people in the squares of Italy and other countries of the continent gathered for a rally in support of Ukraine and against Russian aggression. Millions of people heard my appeal later thanks to broadcasts and recordings. We now enjoy the greatest support in the history of Ukraine for our aspirations and our independence. You can take a public opinion poll in any country and you will see that Ukraine is among the leaders of those who are sympathized with and supported. And Russia is not just among enemies. It is even a bigger enemy, bigger evil than North Korea. That's what Americans think, for example. Ordinary people in all states. As well as ordinary people in all European countries. And I am grateful to them for this extraordinary support. Grateful for understanding our struggle. Because we are united by one dream - to live freely on our land. And we have the right to what everyone has in the free world. To a safe sky, as well as to our own land. Dear Ukrainians! Our heroes!  The world has always loved those who fight against evil. It was our resistance, the courage of all our people that inspired the world. Millions of people in different countries. Who 17 days ago might not have felt what they all have in common. We all have. And now it's obvious. Peace. Freedom. And love for our children. The children we are fighting for. For them to have a future. I signed two important decrees. On awarding 106 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who bravely showed themselves in the battles for the independence of Ukraine. 17 of them, unfortunately, posthumously. But they are heroes. I - the decree on conferring the title of Hero of Ukraine with the award of the Order of the Golden Star to: Senior Sergeant Vasich Serhiy Viktorovych. Posthumously. He bravely defended our positions in the Kyiv region. Destroyed enemy equipment and a significant amount of enemy manpower. Senior soldier Parkhomuk Vitaliy Vasyliovych. Posthumously. During the counterattack on the enemy near the city of Makariv, he inflicted significant losses on the enemy and died heroically defending his brothers-in-arms. Soldier Svynchuk Oleh Anatoliyovych. Posthumously. He heroically performed his duty in the battle against the overwhelming forces of the enemy. He was helping his brothers-in-arms until the last moment. Sergeant Khanin Andriy Pavlovych. Posthumously. Defending Volnovakha, Donetsk region, he destroyed an enemy tank and about 10 enemies. During the battle, when he was wounded, he helped his wounded brothers-in-arms and performed his duty to the last. Sergeant Derusova Inna Mykolaivna. Posthumously. Since February 24, the senior combat medic has performed tasks in the city of Okhtyrka, Sumy region. She saved more than 10 servicemen, risking her own life. She died from artillery shelling by Russian troops, helping the wounded. The first woman - hero of Ukraine, who was posthumously awarded this title. Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine! The title of Hero of Ukraine with the Order of the Golden Star is conferred upon: Senior Lieutenant Hutsul Volodymyr Oleksandrovych. Thanks to his heroic actions in the Kherson region, 25 units of enemy equipment and about 300 invaders were destroyed. Senior Lieutenant Chornyi Volodymyr Volodymyrovych. Thanks to his skilful actions during the defense of Volnovakha, Donetsk region, about 50 enemies and a T-72 tank were destroyed, as well as 5 invaders were captured. Glory to all heroes!

0,"Greetings to all friends of Ukraine! Greetings to all friends of Europe, all friends of freedom! I know that there are over a hundred thousand of you all over the world today. More than a hundred thousand in the squares of different cities. We, Ukrainians, are grateful for this. And now I ask each of you to remember one number in each square... 79. You will understand what this means. I will tell you now what it means for our lives, for each of us. I will tell all one hundred thousand and millions who will hear us afterwards. We are experiencing a terrible war in Ukraine. Europe has not seen such a war since World War II. We did not start this war. This is a brutal and cynical Russian invasion of Ukrainian land. This is a war against the Ukrainian people - against peaceful and sincere people, whom I am sure you have known very well during the years of our independence. And you saw that we are very similar to you. We equally value freedom. We equally value equality. We equally want to live. We just want to live. We equally want only the best, the brightest for our children, for our families. But now we and you live differently. Now when the war is going on and thousands of people have died in it! And 79 children have died in it. 79 children! I'm sure each of you has photos of your loved ones. At home or just on the phone so you can watch when your heart asks for that. Photos of children, photos of parents. Photos of your loved ones. We don't even realize it, but we always know that these photos are not the last. Because we believe that we will see how those who are dearest to us will live. We’ll see how happy our loved ones are. How our children grow up, how they go to university, how they work. How they have their children. And then we will play with our grandchildren. Meet them after school, have dinner together. Everyone in the millions lives with that hope. Hope for a truly peaceful life. For new photos, new memories, new moments of happiness, which our state, Ukraine, is deprived of now. While the war continues, we are in fundamentally different conditions with you. When you can be sure that you and your loved ones have a long future ahead, a normal future. And we want that. And we are happy for you. And for us, what we have may be the last time. Just one last time. Today and never again. As for 79 Ukrainian children. 79 Ukrainian families. Destroyed by this shameful war - the invasion of Russia. 79 families who have lost the most valuable, but who are still forced to fight. They are forced to pull themselves up and survive. And fight. Fight for a future that is over for them. In those photos of 79 children killed in the war. And what should we do... All of us - the Ukrainian people, Europeans - so that this number 79 does not change, does not grow. And so that Europe does not forget Ukraine-79. Russian troops besiege Ukrainian cities. They are trying to destroy them. Imagine! Entire cities! In 2022! In Europe. Our Mariupol, the largest Ukrainian city on the coast of the Sea of Azov, is under complete blockade. It is bombed around the clock. Russian troops drop air bombs on it and fire missiles. They even bombed a maternity hospital and a children’s hospital in Mariupol... This is hatred of all mankind. They kill children and destroy maternity hospitals and children's hospitals. Why? So that Ukrainian women don't even give birth? And this is all over our country, all over Ukraine, which is suffering from the Russian invasion. They have already destroyed dozens of hospitals, hundreds of schools and kindergartens. They are destroying universities. Completely destroying residential areas with carpet bombing. Imagine what it is! And how to survive in this? What does it mean for Ukrainians, for our families, for our children? What does it mean when you can't find peace even in church. Because aviation bombs even churches! Even squares... The same squares as yours... Where you are listening to me now. They bombed the square in our city of Kharkiv - Freedom Square. This is the largest square in Europe, which is no different from your squares. Except that it is destroyed. Destroyed by a Russian missile strike. I am constantly asked in interviews: how can Europe help Ukraine? I formulate the question differently, namely: how can Europe help itself? Because this is a war not only against our people, not only against Ukrainians. This is a war against the values that unite us. Against our ability to live. Live, not kill like the Russian military on our land. Do you feel why we are different from them? We live. And they kill. We are 79 lives. And they are 79 deaths. I am sure that you want to stop the war just like every Ukrainian. That is why my answer about the help that is needed for Ukraine sounds logical, natural to millions of people in democracies. You need to put pressure. Such sanctions against Russia are needed so that every Russian soldier knows the price of every shot at civilians. We need such principles of European business that the Russian state does not have the money to ruin lives. Put pressure on the companies in your countries to leave Russia, so that you are not indirect sponsors of this war and tragedy. Tell your politicians to close the sky over Ukraine from Russian missiles and planes. From those who killed 79 children and thousands of adults! Thousands in 17 days... All this will protect us. We are just like you. Absolutely the same! You know that. You feel it. You see me and you understand all this. And you know that we must be together in the European community. This is extremely important for Ukraine. And this is very important for you, for Europe. Because this will strengthen Europe. This will protect Europe. This will stop the war forever. This will prove that the 79 lives taken in the war for freedom have not been lost in vain. That they are alive. That they live among us. And they are among other children of Ukraine and Europe, who will be able to be free, will be able to dream, will be able to just live as they want. In peace. And not to be afraid that they may be killed. And not to look for the nearest air bomb shelter. Just as you are not looking for it - each of the hundred thousand in the squares of European cities that are listening to me now. And just as millions who, I'm sure, will hear me. Hear about Ukraine-79. About Ukraine-2022. About Ukraine, which seeks peace. And about Europe, for which it is time to choose. Choose Ukraine. For the sake of peace! For the sake of all of us.

From the very morning in the Ukrainian - forever Ukrainian - Melitopol people, our citizens, gathered for the regular protest action against the Russian troops. Against the attempts to put the city to its knees. More than two thousand people in the square. Do you hear it, Moscow? If 2,000 people are protesting against the occupation in Melitopol, how many people should be in Moscow against the war? To make it fair. Yesterday the invaders captured the mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fedorov. The city community is demanding his release. And this is very important. I am grateful to every Melitopol resident for this resistance, for this position. The invaders must see that they are strangers on our land, on all our land of Ukraine, and they will never be accepted. Throughout the night and today we constantly talk to our partners about this situation with our mayor. The demand is simple - to release him from captivity immediately. We appeal to all world leaders who speak to Moscow. France, Germany, Israel and others. I have personally called German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron. I will talk to everyone to free our people. We expect them, the world leaders, to show how they can influence the situation. How they can do a simple thing - free one person. A person who represents the entire Melitopol community, Ukrainians who do not give up. Our Armed Forces are doing everything to deprive the enemy of any desire to continue the war against Ukraine. The losses of Russian troops are enormous. The dynamics of the invaders’ losses on the 17th day is such that it is safe to say that this is the biggest blow to the Russian army in decades. They’ve never lost more than that in such a time period. Since the beginning of the invasion, 31 battalion tactical groups of the enemy have lost their combat capability. The Russian militaries are being taken prisoners not just alone, but in groups. Groups are trying to leave Ukraine and come back to Russia as well. The losses of the invaders in technical capabilities are simply astounding. More than 360 tanks. 1205 armored vehicles. And that's without counting the losses in the battles this night and in the morning. Already almost 60 planes. More than 80 helicopters. Hundreds and hundreds of units of other equipment, including the most modern models, of which Russia is proud. Most of the world's armies do not have as much as Russian troops lost during the invasion. Ukrainians! I want you to understand me correctly. We have had extraordinary success. The resistance of the entire Ukrainian people against these invaders has already gone down in history. But we have no right to reduce the intensity of defense. No matter how difficult it is. We have no right to reduce the energy of resistance. The enemy is bringing new and new columns to the territory of Ukraine. They are looking everywhere for fighters. Reservists. Conscripts. Mercenaries. They are trying to take us with numbers. The number of fighters, the number of equipment. They use terror to break our faith in victory and in Ukraine. I'm sure they won't succeed. It will not work for them. But in order for them not to succeed, we still have to fight. We still need to be focused. All of us, all Ukrainians, still need to continue to focus on defense. Work together. Without internal split. Supporting each other. All over the country. From Uzhhorod to Melitopol. From Chernihiv to Mariupol. From Lviv to Kharkiv. Just like we all have been doing for 17 days of the war. Today we again sent humanitarian aid to Mariupol. We will try every day to save our people. I am grateful to every driver who tries to accomplish this difficult mission. I am grateful to the representatives of the church who joined the efforts to protect the humanitarian corridor in Mariupol from shelling. Ukrainian troops, for their part, guarantee complete ""silence"" along the entire route so that Mariupol receives food, water and medicine. And so that the civilians of Mariupol can go to a safe area. Humanitarian corridors from Makariv, Borodyanka, Trostyanets, Sumy, Poltava, Lebedyn, Konotop, Velyka Pysarivka, Krasnopillya, Polohy, Tokmak, Hostomel, Kozarovychi, Mykulychi and Andriivka of the Kyiv region have also been prepared. The Russian side must ensure ""silence"" on each of these routes. Otherwise, what can Russia guarantee in any negotiations? We continue to work with Europeans in two directions. The first is Ukraine's accession to the European Union. We are working with the European Commission to agree on all procedures for our movement towards the EU as soon as possible. The second direction is sanctions, it is the top priority. We look forward to a new package of European sanctions against Russia to force it to peace. To make it clear: their economy simply will not survive this war. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine has made several very important decisions. The complete abolition of value added tax and excise duty for fuel was approved. For gasoline, for diesel. This is done not only in the context of the sowing campaign, which should start as usual, but also in the context of the needs of all citizens. So that there is no shortage of fuel in the country. So that prices are stable. The government has done its part. Now it's up to the deputies. They must immediately adopt this decision by their vote. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Ruslan Stefanchuk is already organizing the relevant sitting. The second component is to support those Ukrainian communities that receive our migrants from the areas of hostilities. The government has decided to compensate local budgets for utilities payment when accommodating people. According to preliminary estimates, communities in at least ten regions of Ukraine will receive concrete money from the central government to ensure that all IDPs are provided with everything necessary. Ukrainians! Now all of us have to be efficient in our routine as well. We must do our job one hundred percent, help colleagues, take care of our loved ones. And at the same time we must provide everything necessary for our defense. For our defenders. This is a patriotic war. This is a people's war. This is a war for our independence. Independence of not just our state. But of everything Ukrainian that was, is and will be in the world. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Strong people of the steel country! This is how the militaries answer the Kremlin command's question about what prevented them from capturing Ukraine in four days. Strong people of the steel country. This information is unverified, but this fact is indisputable. And if the lost invaders justify their failures with something else, it means that during the 16 days of the war they did not understand anything. Well, we don’t take it so hard. We are ready to explain. Enlighten the invaders until they fully understand who they are and where exactly they should go. Go out of Ukraine. Today in Melitopol the invaders captured mayor of the city Ivan Fedorov. A mayor who courageously defends Ukraine and the people of his community. Obviously, this is a sign of the weakness of the invaders. They did not find any support on our land. Although they counted on it. Because for years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come. They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders. Therefore, they have switched to a new stage of terror, when they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of the legitimate local Ukrainian authorities. It is clear to any democratic state in the world that a legitimately elected mayor is a true representative of the people. Usually it's not about ideology, it's not about politics, it's about the lives of people in a particular community. Probably Russia has become accustomed to this during the years of autocratic rule. Perhaps they believe that the mayor is just a boss which is easy to remove, and it means nothing. But it is Ukraine here. It is Europe here. It is a democratic world here. Therefore, the capture of the mayor of Melitopol is a crime not only against a particular person. Not only against a particular community. And not only against Ukraine. This is a crime against democracy as such. I assure you that one hundred percent of people in all democracies will know this. The actions of the Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists. The whole country saw that Melitopol did not surrender to the invaders. Just as Kherson, Berdyansk and other cities where Russian troops managed to enter didn’t. Temporarily managed to enter. And this will NOT be changed by putting pressure on mayors or kidnapping mayors. This can only get worse. For the invaders. Ukraine demands the immediate release of the mayor of Melitopol and guarantees of full security to all heads of communities across the country. If you are becoming an analogue of ISIS terrorists, then what is the point of talking to you about something at all? We will raise this issue, including in talks with international mediators who communicate with Moscow. Today, Russian troops also disrupted the work of most humanitarian corridors. But, despite everything, 7,144 people were saved. From Enerhodar, Bucha, Hostomel and Kozarovychi. And these are 7,144 reasons to try to organize evacuation for Ukrainians from the besieged cities tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. We will do that. We will do everything to bring humanitarian aid to Ukrainian cities. I have to say this with pain - Mariupol remains blocked by the enemy. Russian troops did not let our aid into the city and continue to torture our people, our Mariupol residents. Tomorrow we'll try again. Once again send food, water and medicine for our city. I am confident that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will respond to every minute of our people's suffering. And it's not pathos. Not a threat. This is a statement of reality. The number of killed Russian servicemen on the territory of Ukraine already exceeds 12 thousand people. 12 thousand! The number of wounded invaders is many times bigger. We did not invite any of them here. And we repeat to each of the invaders: you can still save yourself. At any moment. Just lay down your weapons and go home, leave our land. The number of captured invaders has already reached such a level that this issue cannot be left to the structures that we had before the war. Therefore, today the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine established the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Thousands of enemy soldiers who have been captured or surrendered receive from our state the treatment required by international conventions. But there are so many of them that a special structure is needed to deal with all related issues. I want to say it again for Russian mothers. Especially for mothers of conscripts. Do not send your children to war in a foreign land. Do not believe the promises that they will be sent just somewhere for exercises or just somewhere in non-combat conditions. Check where your son is. And if you have even the slightest suspicion that your son may be sent to the war against Ukraine, act immediately. Do not give your son to death or captivity. Ukraine never wanted this dreadful war. And Ukraine doesn’t want it. But it will defend as much as necessary. Fortunately, we are not alone in this battle. Ukrainians have sincere friends. Good partners. Speaking in the Polish Parliament today, I paid a lot of attention to the importance of not being alone in today's world. How important it is to protect common values. And as a result - to feel that the borders between nations are blurred. To make people closer. Just like our relationship with Polish brothers and sisters. Just like our relationship with all our sincere partners. Because the one who has friends can do anything. I held talks with US President Biden. We discussed how else we can put pressure on Russia to end this war and establish peace. Russia will be deprived of the opportunity to trade normally with the G7 countries. The less dollars Russian business earns and the less taxes the Russian state receives, the less opportunity the Russian military will have to kill our people. Leading international companies are already leaving the Russian market. The Russian government has put its country outside the global world by starting a war against us. By starting this invasion. This is self-closure. Self-humiliation. Self-destruction. In Moscow currency exchange offices, the dollar has already reached 200 rubles. And this is just the beginning. The beginning of international sanctions. The next step is the United States’ ban on bringing dollars into Russia. Consequently, there will be a shortage of currency. So, the course will raise even more. Consequently, prices will rise. Consequently, every citizen of Russia will feel that the absence of peace is a threat to him personally. Not a single country in the world wished harm to ordinary citizens of Russia. Nobody tried to cause any damage until your government started a war with neighbors, peaceful people. A war of annihilation. No one wanted to return ordinary Russian life back to the ""wicked 1990s"". Is that what you call that era? A time of upheaval and poverty. A time of very limited opportunities for ordinary people and very large inequalities. Perhaps now, due to the efforts of propagandists, most Russians do not yet understand what awaits them. But the Russian authorities ALREADY understand this very well. Very clear. And they are very afraid. That is why they are trying to close all free sources of information. Actually all sources of information. Even Instagram and Facebook. But the modern world has learned to deal with such censorship. My advice to thinking Russians is to look for ways to get truthful information. And try to hide your smartphones and computers from the security forces on the streets. They're getting ready to check what's in people's phones. What do people have in laptops. I specifically warn you: learn to resist the repression that your government plans to increase. Because thinking people should be in every country. And in Russia, too. And they are in Russia. And one more thing. Now the good news and the victories of Ukraine for all of us are worth their weight in gold. Or silver and bronze. And all this - for Ukraine - is successfully won by our Paralympians in Beijing. Today, everyone is gaining glory for Ukraine. In his or her place. Shows the world who Ukrainians are and what strength we have. With a weapon in hands on the battlefield or with a sporting rifle on a biathlon track. Our boys and girls have already won 25 medals at the Winter Paralympics! And take second place in the overall standings, second only to the hosts of the competition - China. The Paralympics will end in two days. I would very much like to say the same about the war. That it will end in two days. Unfortunately, this is still unrealistic. But it will definitely happen. Both victory for Ukraine and peace for Ukraine are achievable. And they will be more valuable for us than gold, silver and bronze of the whole world. Well, for now ... Hold our ground! Hold on! We will win! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ladies and gentlemen deputies and senators! Dear Sirs! Polish brothers and sisters! When I became President in 2019, it felt like we had a long way to go with Poland. Because our relationship was pretty cold, our attitude towards each other wasn’t too warm. This was the situation. But I wanted to go this way fast. The path to warmth. Because we are such nations. I knew that we were akin by nature - Ukrainians, Poles. I remember my first meetings with Andrzej Duda. From meeting to meeting everything changed. The coolness disappeared. We understood each other. As a Ukrainian and a Pole. As Europeans. As friends. As parents who love their families and realize that our children must live in a world of equal good values. Our shared values. They must live in a world where nations are independent, where freedom reigns, where the family matters, and where no one ever has the right to war, to invasion. It is believed that the number seven brings happiness. That is how many neighbors God has given to Ukraine. Does it bring us happiness? The whole world knows the answer today. And 78 Ukrainian children who died from rockets and shelling of the Russian Federation know it better than others. A neighbor who brought trouble and war to our land. A neighbor who obviously acts without God. When there is someone who beats like a savage, it is very important to have someone who will lend a hand. And when the foot of the enemy enters your house, he will lend you a helping hand. On the morning of February 24, I had no doubt who it would be. Who will say to me: ""Brother, your people will not be left alone with the enemy."" And so it happened. And I'm grateful for that. Polish brothers and sisters are with us. And this is natural. Just in one day, on the first day of the war, it became clear to me and to all Ukrainians, and, I am sure, to all Poles that there are no more borders between us, between our nations. No physical ones. No historical ones. No personal ones. During the 16 days of this war, Ukrainian pride and Polish honor, Ukrainian courage in battles and Polish sincerity in helping us allow me to say very important words now. Words that there is real peace between our nations. Peace between relatives. Peace between brothers. And now I really want these words to be heard by our common Belarusian neighbors. Peace between relatives, peace between neighbors, peace between brothers. We have to come to this with them as well! We will definitely come! Dear Sirs! Polish brothers and sisters! For a long time, various ""stakeholders"" tried to create an impression that Ukrainians and Poles live differently. And separately. Why did they do all this? I will recall the words of President of the Republic of Poland Lech Kaczyński said in Tbilisi in 2008: ""We know very well: today - Georgia, tomorrow - Ukraine, the day after tomorrow - the Baltic countries and then, perhaps, the time will come for my country - Poland”. On February 24, this terrible ""tomorrow"" for Ukraine came, which President Kaczyński spoke about. And today we are fighting for such a bad time for Poland and the Baltic States to never come. We fight together. We have strength. Remember, there are 90 million of us together! We can do everything together. And this is the historical mission, the historical mission of Poland, the historical mission of Ukraine to be leaders who together will pull Europe out of this abyss, save it from this threat, stop the transformation of Europe into a victim. Dear Sirs! We can do it. We saw yesterday what the countries of the European Union talked about and in what manner. We saw who was the real leader and fought for a strong Europe. For common European security. And who tried to stop us, tried to stop you. We understand why it is so important for Poles to fight with us. Together with all those who are for freedom. For us and for you, for Europe. We remember the terrible tragedy of 2010 near Smolensk. We remember all the facts of the investigation into the circumstances of this catastrophe. We feel what this means for you. And what does the silence of those who also know all this mean to you, but... But they still feast their eyes on Russia.   Polish brothers and sisters! I feel that we have already formed an extremely strong alliance. Even though it is informal. But this is an alliance that grew out of reality, not words on paper. Of the warmth in our hearts, not of the speeches of politicians at summits. Of the way you treated our people. Ukrainians who fled to your country to escape from the evil that came to our land. More than one and a half million citizens of Ukraine! The vast majority are women and children. They do not feel like they are in a strange land. You met our people in your families. With Polish delicacy. With fraternal kindness. Although we did not ask for it. And you did not ask anything for it. It's just the way it is between relatives. That's why I address so simply: friend Andrzej, dear Agata! That's why I claim that we have already united. We united to constantly gain and create freedom, as a great Pole, a close friend of Ukraine John Paul II said. Today, I cannot be sure of all the leaders of all European nations, but I am sure that we will definitely be with you in defending freedom. As much as needed. I am grateful for all the help we have already received from your state, from your people. I am grateful for your efforts so that we can secure the Ukrainian sky. I believe that we will be able to achieve the result in this, the result that we all desperately need. If God allows and we win this war, we will share the victory with our brothers and sisters. This is our greatness. And your greatness. This is a struggle for our freedom, this is a struggle for your freedom. This is the common history of great nations! May God help us win!

0,"Free people of a free country! We have been fighting for our freedom for the 16th day already. This is four times longer than the enemy planned for his invasion. Four times longer! Against the army, which was considered one of the strongest in the world. Which hoped that the Ukrainians would surrender. Hoped that someone would meet Russian flags on Ukrainian streets, on our streets with flowers. But Ukrainians are proud people who always defend their land and will not give the invader a single piece of land. Not a percent of their freedom. 16 days. I know that many people have started to feel tired. I understand. Impatience. I understand. Emotions play a bad game with people. This is life. When we mobilize, when we see our victories and the loss of the enemy on the battlefield, we expect the struggle to end sooner. We expect the invaders to fall faster. But... This is life, this is war. This is a struggle. Time is still needed. Patience is still needed. Our wisdom, energy. The ability to do our job to the maximum so that we can win together. It is impossible to say how many more days we must liberate our Ukrainian land. But it is possible to say - we will do it! Because we strived for that. Because we have already reached a strategic turning point. We are already moving towards our goal, towards our victory. This is a patriotic war. War with a very stubborn enemy who does not pay attention to the thousands of his killed people, killed soldiers. Who is now gathering reservists and conscripts all over Russia to throw them into the hell of this war. Who came up with the idea of throwing mercenaries against our people. Thugs from Syria. From the country that was destroyed in the same way as the invaders are destroying us now - our Mariupol, our Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv, Volnovakha, Izyum, etc. This is how Russian troops treat Ukrainians. This is how they treat Donbas, Russian-speaking people, as they said. How they shouted to everyone about ""protection"", which they talked about so much in Moscow. Rockets, air bombs, artillery. And now Syrian mercenaries who do not distinguish at all who speaks what language here, what church people go to, what party people supported. Mercenaries who simply go to kill in a foreign land - in every sense of the word. Over the past night and morning, the invaders carried out, as they say, ""demilitarization"" of the water supply system in Chernihiv. The city was left without water. We are doing everything to restore the water supply. Due to constant shelling in parts of the Sumy, Kyiv, Donetsk regions there is no electricity, yes, there are problems with heating, no gas, water. This is a humanitarian catastrophe. Humanitarian catastrophe - two words that have become fully synonymous with the other two words - the Russian Federation. At night, the invaders bombed a shoe factory, an apartment building and a kindergarten in Dnipro. For what? How did they threaten the Russian state? They destroyed residential houses in the villages of the Sumy region. They continued torturing Mariupol residents, Kharkiv residents. They fired rockets at Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk... If this continues, sanctions against Russia are not enough. And I expect, we are already working on this, new sanctions from our partners today. Russia must pay for this terrible war. Pay daily! A very important meeting of the leaders of the European Union took place yesterday. Long, substantive. We know what was said at this meeting. What all leaders said. Who specifically spoke. Who supported. Who remained silent. And who tried to make the wording insufficient - for Ukraine, Europe and our common freedom. How do we evaluate the decision made? It's very simple: it must be stronger. This is not what we expect. It is necessary that the decisions of politicians coincide with the mood of their nations, European nations. We are aware of this mood. And they are aware of this mood. Every politician is well aware! The numbers are different in different countries, but there are polls and support is huge. At least 60 percent stand in favor. And this is the vast majority which stands for Ukraine to be part of Europe! Europeans are clearly talking about this. And I'm sure they will clearly tell their politicians about this. If they haven't figured it out yet. The decision of yesterday's meeting of EU leaders now reaches the level of the European Commission. For implementation. For specific procedures. The European Union must do more. It must do more for us, for Ukraine. And for itself. We are waiting for that. All European nations are waiting. Our government officials have organized 12 humanitarian corridors today. Cargo with food, water, medicine is already on the way. Izyum, Enerhodar, Volnovakha, Polohy, Bucha, Hostomel, Borodyanka, Andriivka, Mykulychi, Makariv, Kozarovychi, of course, Mariupol. The Ukrainian servicemen have ensured ""silence"" for the humanitarian corridors to work. If the invaders shoot and disrupt the rescue of people again, they will eventually receive such a response from the world that they themselves will need humanitarian corridors. Our government officials, despite difficulties, are doing everything to ensure that there is fuel, products, medicines and all goods people need throughout the country. Gasoline, diesel - everything is imported. This morning I was asked a question at a daily conference call. Logical question. Given the spring. What about sowing? How to start it, especially in those areas that are temporarily occupied? My answer is very simple: all over our land, no matter what, we have to organize a full-fledged sowing campaign this spring. Of course, as much as possible. It all depends on the people and the situation. Because it's about life. Life is more important. It’s about our life. About our dreams. About our future. And therefore, about our victory. I repeat again and again: when we defend freedom, everyone must be like a full-fledged army. Do everything we can in our place to get the result we all deserve. That's fair. To win. Necessarily. Be sure to hold on. Be sure to fight. Be sure to give your all strength. It will not be easy with such a neighbor. But with us, it will not be easy, too. As it already turned out. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! One of the main tasks for us today was the organization of humanitarian corridors. Sumy, Trostyanets, Krasnopillya, Irpin, Bucha, Hostomel, Izyum. Almost 40,000 people have already been evacuated this day. They were given safety at last. In Poltava, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, Lviv. Humanitarian cargoes were also delivered. Hundreds of tons of food, medicine. We are doing everything to save our people in the cities that the enemy just wants to destroy. Taking into account the work of humanitarian corridors in the previous two days, we have already evacuated about one hundred thousand people. But… Mariupol and Volnovakha remain completely blocked. Although we did everything necessary to make the humanitarian corridor work, Russian troops did not cease fire. Despite this, I decided to send a convoy of trucks to Mariupol anyway. With food, water, medicine. I am grateful to the drivers - brave people who were ready to fulfill this mission. An extremely important mission. But the invaders started a tank attack exactly in the area where this corridor was supposed to be. Corridor of life. For the people of Mariupol. They did it consciously. They knew what they were disrupting. They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to torture it, to carry out constant bombardment. Today they destroyed the building of the main department of the State Emergency Service in the Donetsk region. Right next to this building was the place where Mariupol residents were to gather for evacuation. This is outright terror. Blatant terror. From experienced terrorists. The world needs to know that. It has to admit it. We are all dealing with a terrorist state. But no matter what, we will try! Constantly! We will continue to try to bring to Mariupol the aid that people so desperately need. Ukrainians need. The invaders are doing everything to deceive our people in the besieged cities. They block communication. Prevent the provision of Information. The state is doing everything to help our city. Everything to tell the people of Mariupol: we are fighting. And we will not give up this fight. Therefore, if you have the opportunity to talk to the people of Mariupol, to write to the people of Mariupol, spread the truth. Remind them that Ukraine is with them wholeheartedly and is doing everything to stop the torture of the city. Russian propagandists have substantially intensified their activity today. And they tried very hard. Probably in order to cover up the crimes of their army in Ukraine. Crimes against Mariupol. Against Donbas. Against Kharkiv. Against dozens of other cities. Cover them up with new accusations. New-old fakes. They accuse us... Again us! That we are allegedly developing biological weapons. Allegedly, we are preparing a chemical attack. This makes me really worried, because we’ve been repeatedly convinced: if you want to know Russia's plans, look at what Russia accuses others of. Look, spreading such accusations in the Russian media shows that it is THEY who are capable of this. The Russian military, the Russian special services. It shows that they want it. They have already done such things in other countries. Similar! They themselves announced, they themselves organized, they themselves complained. And they will do so again. Again and again. If they are not stopped. They tore apart Moldova with Transnistria. They tore apart Georgia with Abkhazia. They tore apart Ukraine with Donbas and Crimea. But they blame us! Those who have become victims. Those who are forced to defend themselves. Fight for the right to live. They themselves come to us in tanks and with missiles. They take something that doesn’t belong to them. Capture. They are even ashamed to show their officers! They hide their generals. They conceal from their own people that they are sending conscripts to this war only to make the invasion forces larger. But we are to blame! We are accused of attacks on allegedly peaceful Russia. And now what? What are these allegations of preparing chemical attacks? Have you decided to carry out ""de-chemicalization"" of Ukraine? Using ammonia? Using phosphorus? What else have you prepared for us? Where will you strike with chemical weapons? At the maternity hospital in Mariupol? At the church in Kharkiv? At the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital? Or at laboratories, most of which have remained since Soviet times and are engaged in ordinary science. Ordinary! NOT military technology. We are adequate people. I am the President of an adequate country, an adequate nation. And the father of two children. And no chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land. The whole world knows that. YOU know that. And if YOU do something like that against US, you will get the most severe sanctions response. Ukrainians! Our defenders! I have signed several important decrees. About awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to thirteen of our defenders: Lieutenant Colonel Litun Andriy Mykolayovych. Posthumously. He died covering our troops and heroically restraining the enemy's offensive. Captain Korpan Oleksandr Bohdanovych. Posthumously. He saved our soldiers and civilian houses when he took the falling aircraft away from them. Junior Lieutenant Blokha Yuriy Ihorovych. Posthumously. In the battles in the Mykolaiv region he heroically protected brothers-in-arms, saving their lives. Senior Sergeant Ivashko Andriy Oleksandrovych. Posthumously. During the rocket fire, he personally provided information about the enemy's actions at the cost of his own life. Junior Sergeant Volkov Yevhen Volodymyrovych. Posthumously. For courage and heroism during the evacuation of the wounded in the Donetsk region, for saving our military. Major General Nikoliuk Viktor Dmytrovych. He skillfully led the defense in the north-eastern direction and managed to prevent the capture of Chernihiv. Colonel Khoda Leonid Oleksiyovych. During the war, under his command, more than 50 enemy vehicles were destroyed. Lieutenant Colonel Ponomarenko Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych. Thanks to his actions, a significant number of enemy’s equipment and soldiers in the city of Hostomel were destroyed. Lieutenant Colonel Yakovenko Oleksandr Oleksiyovych. He withdrew his units from the enemy artillery fire, thanks to which he saved personnel and continued to successfully defend the Donetsk region. Major Bova Yevhen Petrovych. For the heroic defense of Mariupol and holding positions under constant enemy attacks. Captain Boyechko Vasyl Vasyliovych. For the extremely successful destruction of enemy equipment and manpower. Sergeant Moroz Oleh Romanovych. Thanks to his heroic deeds, the enemy's offensive in the Luhansk region was stopped. Sailor Samofalov Valeriy Mykhailovych. In one battle, for the first time in the history of this war, he shot down three enemy helicopters. I also signed a decree awarding orders for personal courage to 39 national guardsmen, 31 policemen (9 posthumously), 14 border guards (4 posthumously) and 23 employees of the State Emergency Service. Today the rank of Brigadier General is awarded to: Nechayev Oleh Oleksandrovych. For the successful defense of the Kyiv region. Lishchynsky Vladyslav Vatslavovych. For extremely successful actions against the enemy in the Kherson region. Hutsol Volodymyr Volodymyrych. For the successful destruction of enemy airborne troops in Vasylkiv. Demyanchyk Hryhoriy Petrovych. For the successful organization of personnel training for our military units. And finally. Discussions on Ukraine's future in the EU continue today and tomorrow in Europe. I believe that our people, our state, our army did everything for us to be welcome there. As equals. For us to be invited there. This is the final exam for Europe. Among the leaders of the states there are those who support us. And there are also those who support only themselves. But we see how the nations of all European countries treat us. And this is the main thing. Because I know for sure - if people decided on our membership in the EU, they would definitely choose the people of Ukraine. Today, when I see the support of the people of each country in the squares of European capitals, I know that the Ukrainian people are already in the European Union. And politicians... I'm sure they will adjust to that. Preferably faster. Glory to the nations of Europe!  Glory to Ukraine! Glory to our military! Thank you!

0,"Ukrainians! Information about the victims of yesterday's bombing of the maternity hospital and the children's hospital in Mariupol appeared last night. We lost three people, including a child, a girl. The number of wounded is 17. These are children, women, medical workers. You know, this topic was mentioned on Russian television. It was on their talk show. But not a word of truth was said. The Russians were lied to that there had been no patients in the hospital and no women or children in the maternity hospital. The Russians were lied to that ""nationalists"" had allegedly taken up positions there. They lie confidently, as always. War crimes are impossible without the propagandists who cover them up. I want to tell them one thing: you will bear responsibility just as all those who give orders to bomb civilians. We will find all the property of the propagandists and their associates. We will do our best to confiscate it wherever it is. You love a rich life. Love prosperous countries. You will not have this anymore. And this is just the beginning. You will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes. And then, it will definitely happen, you will be hated by Russian citizens. Everyone whom you have been deceiving constantly, daily, for many years in a row. When they feel the consequences of your lies in their wallets, in their shrinking possibilities. In the stolen future of Russian children. War is never isolated. It always beats both the victim and the aggressor. The aggressor just realizes it later. But it always realizes and always suffers. Today, we are once again providing humanitarian corridors for our cities. The buses have already departed, the trucks are already on their way - with food, water, medicine. Mariupol, Volnovakha, Izyum, Sumy and the region. Cities and towns of the Kyiv region - Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin, Hostomel... My heart is broken by what the invaders did to our cities, to our state! And by what they want to do to our people who need urgent help. Russian troops have already created a humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. But for them it is part of the plan. They want to humiliate our people. Make them take bread and water from the hands of the invaders standing on their knees. So that Ukrainians can save their lives just by going to the occupied territories or to Russia. That's why they are blocking Mariupol, that's why they are blocking Volnovakha, blocking other cities. The invaders specially organize this torture to give their propaganda channels new material. Just for that. Monsters. Despite everything, updated information was received every hour yesterday about people whom we managed to evacuate to the free territory of Ukraine. In total, more than 60,000 of our citizens were rescued yesterday plus those who did not have time until night and continued the evacuation in the morning. I spoke today, in particular about that, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. About the torture of our cities, our people. I spoke with French President Macron. I felt in a conversation with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson that our anti-war coalition will soon become much stronger. Consequently, the pressure on Russia for peace will also be much stronger. For us, specifics in relations with world leaders, with European leaders are very important. We are really fighting for our independence! For freedom, for equality for all on the continent! That is why we want to see from partners the decisions based on reality, not on declarations or abstract considerations. These days, the EU leaders will convene to discuss Russia's war against Ukraine. To discuss our application for EU membership. We are waiting for a concrete signal. We look forward to strong support. Because it will be fair, real, human, European. We know exactly the position of every leader. We know exactly who stands with us and who thinks that the European Union is just accounting, profits, expenses and nothing more. We will work, we will persuade. Life will convince them. Ukrainians! Our defenders! We all have been defending our state for the 15th day. We endured. The Ukrainian army is repelling attacks in key directions. Thanks to our military, National Guards, border guards, police, territorial defense and everyone who joined the defense of the state, we have not become slaves, and will never become! Because this is our spirit, this is our destiny. Pride for our Armed Forces of Ukraine is boundless! After the war, after our victory, we will rebuild everything that was destroyed. Very quickly and with a very high quality. A special state program for reconstruction will be created for each affected city. I have already instructed the government to start the elaboration. Chernihiv and Sumy, Okhtyrka and Zhytomyr, Izyum, Mariupol and all our beautiful cities to which evil has come will not see a single trace of the Russian invasion. The best architects, the best companies, the best projects. For every city! I want to say this on the example of Kharkiv. Our Kharkiv, which is now experiencing the worst suffering since World War II. Saltivka, Oleksiivka... Perhaps most Ukrainians know nothing about these names. But the people of Kharkiv will hear. Freedom Square will be such that everyone, all of us, all Europeans will be there! Poltava Way, Belgorod Highway, Myronosytska Street, Regional Children's Hospital, Kharkiv Oncology Center, Karazin University, Labor Palace, Korolenko Library. We will rebuild everything! I promise you personally. Kharkiv residents will see that Ukraine stands with them. And it really does. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Europeans! Ukrainians! Mariupol residents! Today is the day that defines everything. Defines who is on whose side. Russian bombs fell on a hospital and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Children's hospital. Maternity hospital that is functioning! Buildings are destroyed. As of now, there are 17 wounded. Disassembly of the debris is still ongoing. People began to hide from the air threat in time. From 500 kg aviation bombs dropped by the invaders on Ukrainian cities. Many times already. Children's hospital. Maternity hospital. What did they threaten the Russian Federation with? What kind of country is this - the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals and maternity hospitals and destroys them? Were there little Banderivtsi? Or were pregnant women going to fire at Rostov? Did someone in the maternity hospital abuse Russian-speakers? What was that? Was it the denazification of the hospital? It is beyond atrocities already. Everything that the invaders are doing to Mariupol is beyond atrocities already. Europeans! Ukrainians! Mariupol residents! Today, we must be united in condemning this war crime of Russia, which reflects all the evil that the invaders brought to our land. All destroyed cities. What they did to Volnovakha, Kharkiv, Izyum, Okhtyrka, Chernihiv, Borodyanka, Hostomel, Zhytomyr and dozens of other Ukrainian cities, which never posed any threat to the Russian Federation. Destroyed hospitals. Destroyed schools, churches, houses. And all the people killed. All the children killed. The air bomb on the maternity hospital is the final proof. Proof that the genocide of Ukrainians is taking place. Europeans! You won’t be able to say that you didn't see what happened to Ukrainians, what happened to Mariupol residents. You saw. You know. Therefore, you must increase sanctions against Russia so that it no longer has any opportunity to continue this genocide. You must put pressure on Russia to force it to sit down at the negotiating table and end this brutal war. Moscow knows very well that Mariupol is also the Donetsk region. We have heard so much from Russia about the inhabitants of the Donetsk region. So many accusations, so many demands... And now we see how Russia actually treats the residents of the Donetsk region. Treats ordinary people who live in the houses of Mariupol, work at the enterprises of the city of Mariupol, are treated in hospitals of Mariupol and give birth to children, imagine, people like you give birth to children in the maternity hospitals of Mariupol. We have not done and never would have done anything similar to this war crime to any of the cities of the Donetsk, Luhansk or any other region. To any of the cities on earth. Because we are people. And you? I spoke today with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. We also worked and spoke with Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Thank you for your support, Boris. The partners are fully informed about what is happening in our Mariupol. And about the situation in all other regions of Ukraine, where hostilities continue. We are working to make Russia feel the consequences of its actions. We are doing everything to finally secure our sky. I am grateful to the vast majority of Ukrainians who support this position. Those who collect signatures, who convince their acquaintances in the West, write on social networks, organize rallies. Together we must return courage to some Western leaders. So that they finally do what they had to do on the first day of the invasion. Either close the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and bombs, or give us fighter jets so that we can do everything ourselves. A pause without a decision has become simply deadly. Today we managed to organize the work of three humanitarian corridors. From the city of Sumy, from the cities and towns of the Kyiv region and from Enerhodar. In total, about 35,000 people were rescued. We will continue tomorrow. We are preparing six corridors. We pray that people will be taken out of Mariupol, Izyum, Volnovakha, etc. Taken to safe cities of our free Ukraine. And I am sure that every Ukrainian whose help these people need will do everything possible to make them feel our care. Until they can return home. And finally. Every year on March 9, the winners of the Shevchenko Prize are announced. Our national award for the most significant contribution to the preservation and development of the Ukrainian spirit, our national culture. I believe that our traditions must be observed during martial law and the fierce battles for our freedom. We must not betray them so that we preserve all ours, Ukrainian, completely while we are heading to victory. While we are heading to peace. The decree was signed. Now I look forward to meeting the winners. But after the victory. After the victory of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Brave Ukrainians of the unconquered country! It is already the 14th day of our defense. The 14th day of our unity. Truly all-Ukrainian. The scale of the threat to the state is maximum. The invasion contingent has already brought into our territory almost everyone who was gathered to invade Ukraine. But the scale of our answer is maximum as well. And these are two different words ""maximum"".  They have only equipment. At the maximum. We have our people in addition to the equipment. Up to the mark. They only have orders. To attack, to kill, to abuse. And we have a real desire of millions of Ukrainians to win. Defend ourselves. Clear our state... And on the renewed land There will be no enemy, adversary, And there will be a son, and there will be a mother, And there will be people on the land. Today is Taras Shevchenko's birthday. This is our old dream. It is his dream to clean the land. And it is alive! And quite real. Ukrainians! Everything is in our hands! We withstood and inspired the whole world with our determination. There is no such place on earth where they are not aware of the heroism with which the Ukrainian people defend our beautiful land. Even where we are not supported, they know well what we have achieved. And they feel what else we will achieve if we save the country. If we maintain unity. National force. If we continue to respond wisely and boldly to the activity of the enemy who can destroy the walls of our homes, our schools, our churches, who can destroy Ukrainian enterprises, but will never reach our soul, our heart, our ability to live freely and fight boldly. Our military and territorial defense units managed to replenish the arsenal of our equipment due to the many trophies they took on the battlefield. Enemy tanks, armored vehicles, ammunition will now work for our defense. For our lives. For our country. What could be more humiliating for the invaders? We will beat the enemy with his own weapons. In addition to ours, which the Russian troops have already felt well, so that more and more enemy soldiers and commanders are asking themselves a simple question: why were they sent to this foreign land, to this war? And we have no answer. Except for one word - death. Russian soldiers! You still have a chance to survive. Almost two weeks of our resistance have shown you that we will not give up. Because this is our home. These are our families and children. We will fight until we regain our land and take revenge for all our killed people. For the killed children. You can still be saved if you just leave. Do not believe your commanders when they tell you that you still have a chance in Ukraine. Nothing is waiting for you here. Except for captivity, except for death. You take our lives and give yours. And we know - we have communications interception - that your commanders already understand everything. This war must be ended. We must return to peace. Leave our home, go back to yours. 14 days of a full-scale brutal war. Terror against our people. Destruction of cities, blockade of entire districts, constant bombing... 14 days of absence of a vital decision. Not our decision! We would make that decision in hours if we had to help our friends. From the first day of the Russian invasion, Ukraine has been repeating to its partners that if you do not close the sky, you will also be responsible for this catastrophe, a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe. Russia uses missiles, aircraft, helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. This is the world's humanitarian duty to respond. But... There is no decision. We are grateful to Poland for the alternative - for its readiness to provide Ukraine with combat aircraft. The problem is in logistics. In fact, it is a technical issue. It must be solved! Immediately. There is an official decision of Poland to transfer the planes to the relevant base - the American base. We also have confirmation - we have all heard - that the agreement between the American party and Poland has been reached. But at the same time we hear that Poland's proposal is allegedly unfounded. And that's what they say in Washington. We also read this. So when will the decision be made? Listen: we have a war! We do not have time for all these signals. This is not ping pong! This is about human lives! We ask once again: solve it faster. Do not shift the responsibility, send us planes. Yesterday we finally managed to organize a humanitarian corridor. From the city of Sumy to Poltava. 1,600 students and 3,500 residents were rescued. Evacuation of people from cities and towns of the Kyiv region continues. More than 18,000 people have already been rescued from Dymer, Vorzel and Irpin. Today we will do everything to continue the functioning of humanitarian corridors. Sumy - Poltava. Izyum - Lozova. Enerhodar - Zaporizhzhia. Mariupol - Zaporizhzhia. Vorzel, Bucha, Borodyanka, Hostomel to Kyiv. Our government officials are working on this, our servicemen have created all the conditions. If there is at least one shot, full responsibility lies with the invaders. And you have already seen the world’s response. Powerful. Sanction packages. In the morning I spoke with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. We have full understanding. Full support. Our delegation returned from Belarus last night, from negotiations. I will listen to their report. We will prepare for the next rounds of talks. For the sake of Ukraine. For peace. And finally. Concerning our unity. This is our strength. This is what is needed at this time. We are receiving a lot of signals that someone in Ukraine has decided that he or she may not fight anymore together with everyone. And tries somehow separately, for something personal, for some personal benefit... We are receiving various signals that some politicians are looking for threads to Russia again. And some others are again working for a split, contrary to unity. I want to say one thing and only once: I see what you are doing. If I hear another signal, the answer will be quick. As befits wartime. Thank God, our people have already sorted everything and everyone out. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Today we have important news. The United States has taken a step that will significantly weaken the invaders. It will make them pay for aggression and be responsible for the evil they have done. For all the evil. America bans imports of oil from Russia, petroleum products, gas, coal. Prohibits US citizens from any investment in Russia's fuel and energy sector. I am grateful personally to President of the United States Biden for this decision. For this leadership. For this most powerful signal to the whole world. It is very simple: every penny paid to Russia turns into bullets and projectiles that fly to other sovereign states. Either Russia will respect international law and will not wage wars, or it will not have the money to start wars. Another gas station will be found. But it's not just about the money. A ban on oil imports to the United States will weaken the terrorist state economically, politically and ideologically. Because it is about freedom, about the future. About where the world will go. The United Kingdom is also banning the import of oil and petroleum products from Russia. I am grateful to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the principled position you expect from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in difficult times. Speaking today in the British Parliament, I mentioned other difficult times. Other, yet similar. 1940, when tyranny threatened what it considered a small island. And it was sure that the island would not withstand brutal blows, bombings and a blockade. And it turned out that the island could do more than that tyranny. Because it had wisdom. And endurance. And friends. And strength. And it believed in the future, the future of its own and the future of freedom in Europe. As we believe. As we fight. And as we will win. Look: the world does not believe in the future of Russia, does not talk about it. Not a word, not a prospect. They understand everything. They talk about us. They help us. They are preparing to support our reconstruction. After the war. Because everyone saw that for the people who defend themselves so heroically, this ""after the war"" will surely come. There will be a new Marshall Plan for Ukraine. The West will form this support package. The British Prime Minister said this today. A man of his word, a sincere friend of Ukraine. We are already expecting tough decisions from the European Union. Sanctions. Against Russia. For this war. For this aggression, which its authors will regret. They will. For sure. That is why it is so important that the Russian leadership realizes that the world will follow the example of the United States, Great Britain, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Japan and other free countries. So, the world cannot be fooled. Sanctions cannot be avoided. I am grateful to those Russians who support us, take to the streets and fight. They are fighting daily for us and for themselves. Because they are fighting for peace. The war must end. We need to sit down at the negotiating table - honest, substantive, in the interests of the people, not obsolete murderous ambitions. I spoke today with Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands. We have a new page in relations with the Netherlands. Thank you for your support. With Prime Minister of Israel Bennett. With Prime Minister of Luxembourg Bettel and President of France Macron. We have support. We have an understanding. You may have seen in the news today the story that the United Nations allegedly does not consider the Russian invasion a war. I know this outraged many, and not only in Ukraine. I am grateful to our team. We made everything clear and quickly received assurances: there will be no lies in the UN structures. There will be no playing along with the aggressor. The word ""war"" will be heard on this site. Because that is the truth. We will not allow anyone in the world to ignore the suffering and murder of our people, our children. Today, when I spoke to the British Parliament, the scariest number was 50. 50 Ukrainian children killed in 13 days of war. And in an hour it was 52. 52 children. I will never forgive that. And I know that you will never forgive the invaders. Like Kharkiv, Mariupol and all other cities. In the evening, they fired a missile at Korbutivka in the Zhytomyr region. Destroyed the dormitory. How could an ordinary dormitory threaten Russia? What geopolitical interests of the nuclear state were threatened by it? Eternal memory to all the people who were killed by these savages. Today we managed to organize a humanitarian corridor from the city of Sumy to Poltava. Hundreds of people were saved. The humanitarian cargo was delivered. But that's only one percent of what needs to be done, of what people, blocked Ukrainians expect. We are ready. Our cargo is ready. Our transport is ready. But ... savages - they are not ready. They fire at evacuation routes. They block the delivery of essential products and medicines to people. What do they want? They want Ukrainians to take it from the hands of the invaders. This is torture. Deliberate. Systematic. Organized by their state. Foreign to us. And ruthless for everyone, even for its citizens. Oleshky in the Kherson region. Berdyansk and Melitopol in the Zaporizhzhia region. All the cities where Ukrainians are resisting, where they are protesting against the invaders... Know: we stand with you. We are grateful. The cargo will still go. No matter how many bullets stop them. Humanitarian corridors will still work. And only time separates you from freedom. Short time. Believe it. I believe.

0,"Ladies and gentlemen! I’m addressing all the people of the United Kingdom. All the people of Great Britain. Great people. With a great history. I’m addressing you as a citizen, as President of a great country as well. With a great dream. And a great struggle. I want to tell you about our 13 days. 13 days of fierce war, which we did not start and did not want. But we are waging it. Because we do not want to lose what we have, what is ours - Ukraine. Just as you did not want to lose your island when the Nazis were preparing to start the battle for your great power, the battle for Britain. 13 days of our defense. On the first day at 4 am, cruise missiles were fired at us. So that everyone woke up - we, the children, all of us, living people, all of Ukraine. And we haven't slept since. We all took up arms becoming a large army. The next day we fought off attacks in the air, on land and at sea. And our heroic border guards on Zmiinyi Island in the Black Sea told everyone about the end of the war. Namely: where the enemy will go in the end. When a Russian ship demanded that our guys lay down their weapons, they answered him... As firmly as one cannot say in the parliament. And we felt the power. Great power of our people who will persecute the invader to the end. On the third day, Russian troops openly fired at people and apartment buildings without hiding. Used artillery, air bombs. And it finally showed us, showed the world who is who. Who are great people and who are just savages. On the fourth day, when we have already begun to take dozens of prisoners, we have not lost our dignity. We didn’t abuse them. We treat them like people. Because we remained human on the fourth day of this shameful war. On the fifth day, the terror against us has already become outright. Against cities, against small towns. Ruined districts. Bombs, bombs, bombs, again bombs on houses, on schools, on hospitals. This is genocide. Which did not break us. It mobilized each and every one of us. And it gave us a sense of great truth. On the sixth day, Russian missiles hit Babyn Yar. This is the place where the Nazis executed 100,000 people during World War II. 80 years later, Russia killed them for a second time. On the seventh day, we realized they were destroying even the churches. Using bombs! Rockets again. They do not know the holy and great as we know. On the eighth day, the world saw Russian tanks firing at a nuclear power plant. The largest in Europe. And the world began to understand that this is terror against all. This is a great terror. On the ninth day, we listened to a meeting of NATO countries. Without the desired result for us. Without courage. That's how we felt - I don't want to offend anyone - we felt that alliances don't work. They can't even close the sky. That is why security guarantees in Europe must be built from scratch. On the tenth day, unarmed Ukrainians protested everywhere in the occupied cities. Stopping armored vehicles with bare hands. We have become unbreakable. On the eleventh day, when residential areas were already bombed, when everything was destroyed by explosions, when children were evacuated from a damaged children's oncology hospital... We realized: Ukrainians became heroes. Hundreds of thousands of people. Entire cities. Children, adults - all. On the twelfth day, when the losses of the Russian army have already exceeded 10,000 killed, the general also appeared in this number. And this gave us confidence: for all crimes, for all shameful orders there will still be responsibility before the International Court or Ukrainian weapons. On the thirteenth day, a child died in Russian-occupied Mariupol. Died of dehydration. They do not allow food or water to people. They just blocked it - and people are in the basements. I think everyone hears: people don't have water there! In 13 days of the Russian invasion, 50 children were killed. 50 great martyrs. This is dreadful! This is emptiness. Instead of 50 universes that could live, they took them away. They just took them away. Great Britain! Ukraine did not strive for that. It did not seek greatness. But it became great during these days of this war. Ukraine that saves people despite the terror of the invaders. Defends freedom despite the blows of one of the world's largest armies. Defends despite the open sky. Still open to Russian missiles, aircraft, helicopters. ""To be or not to be?"" - You know this Shakespearean question well. 13 days ago, this question could still be raised about Ukraine. But not now. Obviously, to be. Obviously, to be free. And if not here, where should I remind you of the words that Great Britain has already heard. And which are relevant again. We shall not give up and shall not lose! We shall go the whole way. We shall fight in the seas, we shall fight in the air, we shall defend our land, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight in the woods, in the fields, on the beaches, in the cities and villages, in the streets, we shall fight in the hills ... And I want to add: we shall fight on the spoil tips, on the banks of the Kalmius and the Dnieper! And we shall not surrender! Of course, with your help, with the help of the civilization of great countries. With your support, for which we are grateful and on which we rely. And I am especially grateful to you, Boris, my friend! Increase sanctions against the terrorist state. Recognize it as a terrorist state finally. Find a way to make our Ukrainian sky safe. Do what you can. Do what you have to. Do what the greatness of your state and your people obliges to. Glory to the great Ukraine! Glory to Great Britain.

When the war continues. A full-scale terrorist war against our people. The people of Ukraine. The invaders bombed Sumy again. With air bombs. Our peaceful city that has never threatened Russia in its history! Good, quiet, soulful Sumshchyna! Which is turned into hell. Mariupol. Peaceful and hard-working city without any internal malice. It was surrounded. Blocked. And is being deliberately exhausted. Deliberately tortured. The invaders deliberately cut off communication. Deliberately block the delivery of food, water supply. Turn off the electricity. In Mariupol, for the first time in dozens of years, perhaps for the first time since the Nazi invasion, a child died of dehydration. Hear me, today, dear partners! A child died of dehydration. In 2022! We have been fighting for the thirteenth day. We destroy the invaders wherever we can. Everywhere. But there is a sky. Hundreds of Russian cruise missiles. Hundreds of fighter jets of the invaders. Hundreds of helicopters. Yes, we destroy them. Russia has not lost as much aircraft in the past 30 years as in these 13 days in Ukraine. But they still have enough machinery to kill. There are still enough missiles for terror. They still have enough 500 kg bombs to drop them on us, ordinary people. On Chernihiv and Kyiv. Odesa and Kharkiv. Poltava and Zhytomyr. Dozens and dozens of Ukrainian cities. On millions of peaceful Ukrainian people. It has been 13 days of promises. 13 days when we are told that there will soon be help in the sky. There will be planes. They will be handed over to us... The blame for every death of every person in Ukraine from air strikes and in blocked cities, of course, lies with the Russian state, the Russian military, those who give and those who carry out criminal orders, who violate all the rules of warfare, who deliberately exterminate the Ukrainian people. The fault lies with the invaders. But the responsibility for this lies also with those who have not been able to make an obviously necessary decision somewhere in the West, somewhere in the offices for 13 days. Those who have not yet secured the Ukrainian sky from Russian murderers. Those who did not save our cities from air strikes. From these bombs, missiles. Although they can. Those who do not help in lifting the blockade. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people in the cities are on the verge of life and death. Literally. Not as it sounds in the comments of politicians about providing Ukraine with vital combat aircraft. Vital missile defense. Vitally important! We have heard many assurances and seen many agreements. In particular, on the creation of humanitarian corridors. To save our citizens in Mariupol. But they didn't work. All of them didn’t work. Yet. And I have no more time to wait. We do not have. Mariupol doesn’t have time to wait. It is the invaders who want our people to die. Not us. We sent columns with humanitarian aid to Mariupol. Everything necessary is there! We sent vehicles to rescue people. Drivers understand everything. They are heroes. Brave people! They understand that Russian troops can simply destroy these vehicles on the road. Just as they did, killing people who were just trying to get to a safe territory from the war zone. But if you fire at these vehicles, these people, you should know that it will be before the eyes of the whole world. Everyone will be witnesses. And everyone will testify. When everyone, I repeat this, everyone who gives and fulfills inhuman orders will be severely judged and convicted. We have seen the concrete consent of the Russian side to organize an evacuation corridor from the city of Sumy. And not just for our people. For hundreds of foreigners. Citizens of India, China. These are students who studied in Sumy. You know, I was told that the Red Cross, the International Red Cross, forbids us to use the emblem on vehicles carrying out humanitarian missions. The Red Cross prohibits it as if it is their property. And this is indicative. This says a lot about the fact that some people, very influential, have decided to give up Ukrainians. But we will not allow it. And I will not allow it. Our friends. They are next to us. I will appeal directly to the nations of the world if the leaders of the world do not make every effort to stop this war, this genocide. Of course, we continue to talk to our partners, to the leaders, parliamentarians of all countries who know how to help Ukraine. We have a very busy negotiation period. I spoke with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda. The people of Lithuania always stand by Ukrainians in this struggle. We feel this help and appreciate it. But there are things that are not decided in negotiations, that depend not directly on us, but on humanity, which must win in the leading capitals, must overcome fear, must overcome any benefits. And then we will see that the Ukrainian sky is safe and the Ukrainian cities are unblocked. We can do this together as people of the world. And if the world stands aloof, it will lose itself. Forever. Because there are unconditional values. The same for everyone. First of all, this is life. The right to life for everyone. This is exactly what we are fighting for in Ukraine. Very fiercely, together with our military. This is exactly what these weak invaders want to deprive us of. This is exactly what the whole world must protect. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Monday. Evening. You know, we used to say: Monday is a hard day. There is a war in the country. So every day is Monday. And now we are used to the fact that every day and every night are like that. Today is the 12th. 12th evening of our struggle. Our defense. We are all on the ground, we are all working. Everyone is where they should be. I am in Kyiv. My team is with me. The territorial defense is on the ground. The servicemen are in positions. Our heroes! Doctors, rescuers, transporters, diplomats, journalists... Everyone. We are all at war. We all contribute to our victory, which will definitely be achieved. By force of arms and our army. By force of words and our diplomacy. By force of spirit, which the first, the second and each of us have. Take a look at our country today. Chaplynka, Melitopol, Tokmak, Novotroitske and Kherson. Starobilsk. Everywhere people defended themselves, although they do not have weapons there. But these are our people, and that's why they have weapons. They have courage. Dignity. And hence the ability to go out and say: I'm here, it's mine, and I won't give it away. My city. My community. My Ukraine. Every Ukrainian man and woman who protested against the invaders yesterday, today and will protest tomorrow are heroes. We shout at the invaders together with you. We stand in the squares and streets with you. We are not afraid with you when the invaders open fire and try to drive everyone away. YOU do not back down. WE do not back down. And the one who repeated: ""We are one people"" - certainly did not expect such a powerful reaction. In the south of our country, such a national movement has unfolded, such a powerful manifestation of Ukrainianness that we have never seen in the streets and squares there. And for Russia it is like a nightmare. They forgot that we are not afraid of paddy wagons and batons. We are not afraid of tanks and machine guns. When the main thing is on our side, truth. As it is now. Mariupol and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy. Odesa and Kyiv. Mykolaiv. Zhytomyr and Korosten. Ovruch. And many other cities. We know that hatred that the enemy brought to our cities with shelling and bombing will not remain there. There will be no trace of it. Hatred is not about us. Therefore, there will be no trace of the enemy. We will rebuild everything. We will make our cities destroyed by the invader better than any city in Russia. Enerhodar. Chornobyl. And other places where barbarians just don't understand WHAT they want to capture. WHAT they want to control. Your work, your hard work on critical objects is a real feat. And we see it. We are sincerely grateful for it. The Ukrainian army holds positions. Well done! It inflicts extremely painful losses on the enemy. Defends. Counterattacks. If necessary - can take revenge. Necessarily. For every evil. For every rocket and bomb. For each destroyed civilian object. Today in Makariv, Kyiv region, they fired at the bread factory. For what? The old bread factory! Think about it - to fire at the bread factory. Who should you be to do that? Or to destroy another church - in the Zhytomyr region. The Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin built in 1862. These are NOT people. There was an agreement on humanitarian corridors. Did it work? Russian tanks worked instead. Russian ""Grads"". Russian mines. They even mined the road, which was agreed to transport food and medicine for people and children in Mariupol. They even destroy buses that have to take people out. But ... At the same time, they are opening a small corridor to the occupied territory. For several dozen people. Not so much to Russia, as to propagandists. Directly to their TV cameras. Like, that's the one who saves. Just cynicism. Just propaganda. Nothing more. No humanitarian sense. The third round of negotiations in Belarus took place today. I would like to say - the third and final. But we are realists. So we will talk. We will insist on negotiations until we find a way to tell our people: this is how we will come to peace. Exactly to peace. We must realize that every day of struggle, every day of resistance creates better conditions for us. Strong position to guarantee our future. In peace. After this war. Apart from the dead people and the destroyed cities, the war leaves destroyed the aspirations that once seemed very important, but now ... You don't even mention them. Almost three years ago, as soon as the election took place, we entered this building, this office, and immediately began planning our move. I dreamed of moving from Bankova. Together with the government and parliament. To unload the center of Kyiv and in general - to move to a modern, transparent office - as befits a progressive democratic European country. Now I will say one thing: I stay here. I stay in Kyiv. On Bankova Street. I’m not hiding. And I'm not afraid of anyone. As much as it takes to win this Patriotic War of ours. Today I signed a decree to present state awards of Ukraine to 96 Ukrainian heroes - our military. Including… The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the second degree is awarded to: Major Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Sak. Commander of the mechanized battalion who entered the battle with the battalion tactical group of the enemy and won thanks to a rational approach to combat and non-standard tactics. Captain Rostyslav Oleksandrovych Sylivakin. Commander of the mechanized battalion, which successfully fought the overwhelming forces of the enemy, liberating Ukrainian towns and villages in the Sumy region. The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the third degree is awarded to: Lieutenant Ihor Serhiyovych Lozovyi. Acting as part of the group, he stopped a column of enemy vehicles numbering about 150 units, which was moving in the direction of the Zhytomyr-Kyiv route. Destroyed. Lieutenant Vitaliy Viktorovych Poturemets. He showed exemplary courage and composure in the battle, destroying a column of enemy equipment near the city of Kyiv. He was wounded. The Order ""For Courage"" of the third degree is awarded to: Master Sergeant, Commander of the Automobile Platoon Valentyn Viktorovych Baryliuk. Thanks to his brave actions and personal determination, the tank unit received fuel in time and left the encirclement, destroying the enemy on the way. All 96 of our heroes are like these five! Our gratitude to all the military. Our gratitude to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Our gratitude is boundless. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Peaceful people of a belligerent state!  We have been defending ourselves against the invasion for 12 days already. We never wanted this war. But it was brought to us. We never dreamed of killing. But we have to knock out the enemy. From our land and from our lives. We have to endure what no other European nation has seen in 80 years. And it is on our land that it is decided whether someone else in Europe will fall victim to the same aggression. I’m telling this to the leaders of the world and I hear that they agree. We decide the future of the continent. WIth our resistance. And our friends - with their help. I spoke again with Polish President Andrzej Duda. They help us. Keep working. I spoke with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. With President of France Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister of India Modi. I received very important signals, which, I'm sure, will only strengthen Ukraine. Our theses in conversations with partners are absolutely logical. They are fair. Honest. If the invasion continues and Russia does not abandon its plans against Ukraine, then a new sanctions package is needed. New sanctions, new sanction steps against war and for peace. Boycott of Russian exports. In particular, the refusal of oil and petroleum products from Russia. This can be called an embargo. Or just morality. When you refuse to give money to a terrorist. Boycott of imports to Russia. If they do not want to follow civilized rules, they should not receive goods and services from civilization. Let the war feed them. The international community must act even more decisively. When someone loses their mind, we have to lose fear and forget about commerce. We need to defend ourselves. You have to be moral. Both states and companies. We must fight against the inhuman force that wants to destroy humanity itself. The success of the Ukrainian army. The will of the Ukrainian people.The principled nature of international sanctions. This is the way to peace. At night the invaders fired at Mykolaiv. Right at the residential areas. Using rocket artillery. They fired at Kharkiv, at residential areas of a peaceful city. They fired at other cities of our state. No military sense. Just terror. Residents of Irpen, Bucha, Hostomel and many other towns and villages, which the invader managed to capture, are being held hostage. Temporarily. Until the invaders get punishment. And they will get it. Our Armed Forces know how to do it. The enemy is tired. Demoralized. They came to our land to look for something that has never been here: cowardice, consent to slavery. Any normal person is afraid to look at burned houses. It is obvious. Destroyed panel high-rise buildings. Destroyed ordinary cars. Missiles, air bombs, ""Grads"", mortars. Against people. It feels like it's in another country. But this is in our country. In ours, not somewhere else. In ours. Which has always wanted peace above anything else. How many more deaths and losses are needed to secure the sky over Ukraine? How do civilians in Kharkiv or Mykolaiv differ from Hamburg or Vienna? We are waiting for a decision. Securing the sky. Either with the power you have, or give us fighter jets and air defense systems that will provide us with the strength we need. This is the help that the world should provide not just to Ukraine, but to itself. To prove: humanity will win. As soon as possible. The Government of Ukraine is already working on how to restore our state after the victory. How to give more strength to the country while we are fighting. A special package of assistance to businesses and employees has been created. Sole proprietors of the first and second groups are completely exempt from UST. Enterprises and sole proprietors of the third group are exempt from paying UST for employees who were drafted into the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other defense formations. In particular, the territorial defense. Exemption from land tax and rent for state and communal land in all areas where hostilities are taking place. All this is during martial law and at least a year after its end. The payment of taxes for all enterprises that are unable to pay them is postponed. And this is only the first part of a large aid package. Government support. All leaders of the central government have a clear task: to develop a system of action so that the recovery of Ukraine is rapid and focused only on people. First of all - on people. For us all to return to peace, to normal work. When we return our land, return peace to our land. I am grateful to all business owners and managers who continue to work and fulfill their obligations to their employees. To pay salaries to people - even if the company does not work as before - is to protect Ukraine. The state fulfills all its obligations. Indexed pensions have already been provided to the people. The salary in the budget sphere is paid as it should be. Ukrainians! There are millions of us. And these are millions of ways to fight for our future. For our state. For our freedom. For our national flag. Blue and yellow. Not a tricolor. We defend our flag because it is our worldview. Under the blue and yellow we gained victories at the Olympics. We unfurled this flag both in space and in Antarctica. Under our national flag, our rescuers, firefighters, peacekeepers, medics and everyone else came to the aid of Turkey, Greece, Israel and Georgia, Afghanistan and Montenegro, India, Italy, the Congo and many other countries. What we have never done under this flag is attacking other countries, seizing foreign lands, killing people, peaceful people of other nations. We and terror are different universes. That is why there is no blood on our flag. There are no and will never be black spots on it. There are no and will never be any swastikas on it. The Ukrainian flag is the land. Peaceful, fertile, golden and without tanks. This is the sky. Peaceful, clear, blue and without missiles. So it was. And so it will be. I believe! I know. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Ukrainians! Today is Forgiveness Sunday. A day when we always apologized. To each other. To all people. To God. But today, it seems, many have not mentioned this day at all. Have not mentioned the obligatory words: ""Forgive me."" And the obligatory answer: ""God forgives, and I forgive."" These words seem to have lost their meaning today. At least in part. After everything we went through. We will not forgive the destroyed houses. We will not forgive the missile that our air defense shot down over Okhmatdyt today. And more than five hundred other such missiles that hit our land. All over Ukraine. Hit our people and children. We will not forgive the shooting of unarmed people. Destruction of our infrastructure. We. Will. Not. Forgive. Hundreds and hundreds of victims. Thousands and thousands of sufferings. And God will not forgive. Not today. Not tomorrow. Never. And instead of Forgiveness, there will be a Day of Judgment. I'm sure of it. It seems everything Russian servicemen have already done is still not enough for them. Not enough ruined destinies. Mutilated lives. They want to kill even more. Tomorrow Russia has officially announced the shelling of our territory. Our enterprises. Defense complex. Most were built decades ago. By the Soviet government. Built in cities. And now they are in the middle of an ordinary urban environment. Thousands of people work there. Hundreds of thousands live nearby. This is murder. Deliberate murder. And I have not heard a reaction from any world leader today. From any Western politician. Reaction to this announcement. Think about the sense of impunity of the invaders: they announce their planned atrocities. Why? Because there is no reaction. Because there is silence. Not a word, as if Western leaders have dissolved tonight. For this day. I hope that at least tomorrow you will notice it. React. Say something. We know exactly who prepared this attack. We know exactly how orders will follow the vertical command. We know everything. And we will not forgive anything. The Tribunal is waiting for you. And God's judgment, if you try to hide. The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the West that sanctions against Russia are not enough. Because they didn't understand. Did not feel. They did not see that the world is really determined. Really determined to stop this war. You will not hide from this reality. You will not hide from new murders in Ukraine. There was a lot of talk about humanitarian corridors. There were talks every day about the opportunity for people to leave the cities where Russia came. Russian military. I am grateful to every Ukrainian who stays to defend our cities, even in the encirclement. Our freedom. But I also know that there are people who really need to get out. Who cannot stay. And we heard the promise that there would be humanitarian corridors. But there are no humanitarian corridors. Instead of humanitarian corridors, they can only make bloody ones. A family was killed in Irpen today. A man, a woman and two children. Right on the road. As in the shooting club. When they were just trying to get out of town. To escape. The whole family. How many such families have died in Ukraine! We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war. On our land. We will find every bastard. Which shot at our cities, our people. Which bombed our land. Which launched rockets. Which gave the order and pressed ""start"". There will be no quiet place on this earth for you. Except for the grave. Today I decided to award orders to the heads of regional administrations and mayors who have excelled in the defense of their communities. The Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky of the Third Degree is awarded to: Head of Kharkiv Regional State Administration Oleh Vasyliovych Syniehubov. Head of Mykolaiv Regional State Administration Vitalii Oleksandrovych Kim. Head of Donetsk Regional State Administration Pavlo Oleksandrovych Kyrylenko. Head of Luhansk Regional State Administration Serhiy Volodymyrovych Haidai. Head of Chernihiv Regional State Administration Vyacheslav Anatoliyovych Chaus.

Mayor of Melitopol Ivan Serhiyovych Fedorov. Mayor of Nova Kakhovka Volodymyr Ivanovych Kovalenko. And I decided to award a special title to our heroes, our hero cities. As it has already been once. When we withstood another attack. But a similar attack. Another invasion. But no less brutal invasion. Hero cities will be: Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Mariupol. Kherson. Hostomel. Volnovakha.

0,"I wish you victory, Ukrainian people! I will start with the words of support I hear from our partners. From our friends. Very important words of support backed by concrete steps. Every day and every night I talk to the leaders of many countries, to the leaders of the business community. During all the days of the war, there is almost no hour when Ukraine does not hear what help it will receive. I talked about it again with President Biden last night. I am grateful to him for his determination. For preparing more new solutions for Ukrainians and Europeans. More new sanctions against aggression! And before that I spoke with American congressmen. More than two hundred representatives of both parties of the Congress. They are very sincere. They are fully interested in really helping us, providing concrete assistance. These are conversations that increase our confidence. Because one who is on the side of light will never fall into darkness. The world has the power to close our sky from Russian missiles. From Russian combat aircraft, helicopters. If anyone still doubts, Ukraine needs planes. In fact, it's simple. When you have the will. To make the sky safe. The sky of Ukraine. The sky of Europe. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Australia. And I am grateful to Australians for their moral stance on Russian exports. There must be no port where a terrorist state can make money. The Prime Ministers of Albania, Bulgaria and Israel. Support for Ukraine. Inspirational conversation with Elon Musk. With a man who creates rockets for the future. Instead of killing with rockets for the sake of the past. We talked about how to win now. About how we will cooperate later. After the victory. Support for Ukraine from global business, from the leaders of the most advanced companies is no less important than support from leading countries. When the corporate world stands by you and is not afraid, you have double protection. Triple weaponry. You have a future. Ukrainians!  We have already gained our future. But we are still fighting for our present. It is very important. We are fighting for where the border will be. Between life and slavery. And this is not only our choice. The citizens of Russia are making exactly the same choice right now. These days. During these hours. Between life and slavery. Today. Tomorrow. In the coming week. This is the time when it is still possible to defeat evil without irreparable losses. When for a position they threaten with dismissal or a paddy wagon, not with the Gulag. With material losses but not with execution. Don't miss this opportunity. Social networks, friends, acquaintances, colleagues and relatives. You must be heard! We, Ukrainians, want peace! Citizens of Russia! For you, this is a struggle not only for peace in Ukraine! This is a fight for your country. For the best it had. For the freedom that you have seen. For the wealth that you have felt. If you keep silent now, then only your poverty will speak for you later. And only repression will answer it. Do not be silent! The Russian servicemen who were taken captive by our defenders started speaking. Hundreds and hundreds of prisoners. Among them are the pilots of the planes that bombed our cities. Our peaceful people. We heard their testimony. We saw the documents. Maps. Plans. Elaborated NOT yesterday. This is NOT improvisation. This is war. They prepared this invasion exactly this way - cruelly, cynically. Сonsciously violating the rules of war. Therefore, Kharkiv. Therefore, Chernihiv. Therefore, Sumy. Therefore, Mariupol. And many, many other Ukrainian hero cities have faced pure evil. Atrocity. This was planned. But this will not kill our humanity. Despite everything, we treat war prisoners under the Geneva Convention. Despite everything, our missiles do not hit Russian civilian facilities in response. Or Belarusian. From where rockets fly to our territory every day. Columns of military equipment. Aviation. Against peaceful people. Against peaceful cities. Zhytomyr, Korosten, Ovruch, suburbs of Kyiv, cities in the south... They are preparing to bomb Odesa. Odesa! Russians have always come to Odesa. They have always felt only warmth in Odesa. Only sincerity. And now what? Bombs against Odesa? Artillery against Odesa? Missiles against Odesa? It will be a war crime. It will be a historical crime. Ukrainians!  We have been fighting for 11 days. For freedom. For the state. We withstood. We already understand how we will rebuild our country. We are already forming special funds for reconstruction. There are already four of them. Fund for the Restoration of Destroyed Property and Infrastructure. Fund for Economic Recovery and Transformation. Public Debt Service and Repayment Fund. Small and Medium Business Support Fund. And many more programs to support our people. Heroes who fight for our state. And this is just the beginning. And now we still need strength. Wisdom. Will.

Programmers who joined the information troops. Everyone who joined the territorial defense. Teachers and educators who do not leave children. Police officers. Civil servants. We all withstood the blow together. We will all rebuild our state together. What gives us this confidence? Where is it from? It's not just words. It's not just faith. This is our reality. Unconditional reality. Which is fueled by the energy of our people everyday. Our resistance. Our protest. Kherson. Melitopol. Berdyansk. Konotop. The reality of all cities and towns, rural communities that expel the invaders everyday. By their determination. By their unity. Freedom Square in Kherson is the whole of Ukraine. The streets of Konotop, where locals are shouting at the invaders, are Ukraine. Ukraine, which we know, love, protect and will not give up to any enemy. It is a special heroism to protest when your city is occupied. Even temporarily. When you don't have a weapon and in response you receive gunshots. And you don't run. When you don't have armor and an armored personnel carrier is coming at you. And you do not move aside. That is why the occupation is temporary! It is artificial. Our people, our Ukrainians do not retreat. Do not give up. Do not stop the resistance. They shout to the occupiers - go home. Like a Russian ship! They drive them away from our territory. They block the roads for them. Every meter of our Ukrainian land won by protest and humiliation of the invaders is a step forward, a step towards victory for our entire state. This is a chance to live. Ukrainians! In all our cities where the enemy entered. Feel it. Go on the offensive! You need to go outside! You have to fight! Every time when there is an opportunity. As in Kherson. As in Berdyansk. As in Melitopol. As in Konotop. You need to go out and drive this evil out of our cities. To prevent the creation of new DPR and LPR where normal life is simply impossible. Only slavery. Only on the knees. Donbas! Remember what they said about you: Nobody put Donbas on its knees! And no one will be able to do that! Everyone in Donetsk and Luhansk knows these words. They were often repeated. Earlier. What about today? Donbas, today is the time! We appeal to all people in the temporarily occupied territory. To all who hear us. Whose memory has not been erased by propaganda. Whose eyes have not been closed by fear. Whose soul has not been mutilated by cynicism. Fight for your rights! For your freedom. For Ukraine. Together with Kherson. Together with Berdyansk. Together with Kyiv and all other Ukrainian cities that value life and are not afraid of anything. I know that many of you believed that Ukraine allegedly hates you. Will allegedly attack you. Will allegedly destroy you. Liars on Russian TV talk about it every day. Liars. It's their job to lie to you every day. But this should not be your destiny. Just compare Donetsk after 8 years of war and Kharkiv after 8 days of war. You were told that we are destroying cities. Look at Kharkiv. At Chernihiv. At 500 kg bombs that were dropped on the houses of Ukrainians. They were killing us. They were killing children. Look at Borodyanka. Look at the destroyed schools. At the blown up kindergartens. At the damaged Kharkiv Assumption Cathedral. Look what Russia has done. It did it right in front of your eyes. Protect yourself! Otherwise, it will take your life, too. Your houses. Ukraine does not shoot its people. We do not blow up residential buildings. And everyone in Donbas has always been and will be our people. Our citizens. In Donetsk. Luhansk. Kherson. Berdyansk. Melitopol. Konotop. In all our cities. In all cities of our state. In Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Free people of a free country! It is already the tenth day of our national struggle. Sincere faith. And round-the-clock work. The tenth day is like one infinitely long day. One infinitely long night that does not allow us to have a rest. Today is Saturday. Saturday. This word means nothing during the war. Like Monday or Thursday or any other day. They all became the same. We still protect the state. We still save people. The country does not know weekends anymore. It doesn't matter what time it is. It doesn't matter what date it is. And it will be so until victory. Late at night I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron. And with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Our interaction is constant. Our conversations are daily. I am immensely grateful to each of them. I am immensely grateful to Andrzej for his determination and devotion to our common cause. Protection of people. I am grateful to Andrzej's wife - Agata. They are friends whom I sincerely consider friends and sincerely wish to everyone. We managed to prevent a humanitarian crisis at the border. We managed to organize the situation so that thousands and thousands of Ukrainian women and children were treated decently. Nobody asks about their nationality, faith or how much money they have. In fact, we no longer have a border with Poland. Because we are together on the side of good. We do not have time for borders. I am sure that soon we will be able to tell our people: come back! Come back from Poland, Romania, Slovakia and all other countries. Come back, because there is no more threat. We are already thinking about the future. For all Ukrainians. After the war. About how to revive our cities. How to revive the economy. I spoke with World Bank President David Malpass, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. We have an agreement among the largest financial institutions to support Ukraine. There is already a decision on emergency aid and tens of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. And these are only the first decisions. I emphasize these are only the first. I spoke with Turkish President Erdoğan. I spoke with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. I spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. The main topic is EU membership for Ukraine. I am grateful to Europeans - hundreds of thousands of people in different cities of our continent. Bratislava, Vilnius, Frankfurt, Lyon, Paris, Tbilisi, Prague. They came out yesterday in support of Ukraine. In support of Europe. They came out for peace to be reached as soon as possible. I am grateful to Americans for the unwavering bipartisan majority of ordinary people. We saw the poll. We saw the opinion of ordinary people in America who support ordinary people in Ukraine. Who demand tougher sanctions against Russia for aggression already now. Who support closing the sky now to save the lives of our people. 74 percent of Americans stand for the no-fly zone. 74! The vast majority. What else is needed to make a decision? We are sure that the result is similar in other democratic countries. The Armed Forces of Ukraine bravely hold all key areas of our defense. They are counterattacking the invaders near Kharkiv - defending the city. They are holding the line in Mykolaiv. Kyiv, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Donbas. We inflict losses on the invaders they have not seen in their worst dreams. The Russian army has not reached the planned frontiers. Yet it has reached almost 10 thousand Russian soldiers killed. 10 thousand. This is dreadful! 18-year-old, 20-year-old boys. Very young, almost children. Soldiers who were not even explained why they were going to fight. For what and why they are in a foreign land.  10 thousand. Russia could definitely give these people something else. Instead of death. The Ukrainian people are resisting even where the invaders managed to pass. Unfortunately. But not for long. I admire every Ukrainian who is not silent. Who protests. Who takes the national flag and shows the Russian military that they will lose. They will definitely lose. Because it is impossible to win against people who stop military equipment without weapons in their hands. Who refuse to take anything from the hands of the invaders. Whose situation is tough and dangerous. But they do not lose their dignity. And will never lose it. At the talks in Belarus, the groups agreed on the first step. To bring back at least one percent of humanity from the normal level. Surrounded cities that are being destroyed and experiencing the worst days. Humanitarian corridors must work today. Mariupol and Volnovakha. To save people. Women, children, the elderly. To give food and medicine to those who remain. Our help is already on the way. Everyone who needs help should be able to leave. Those who are willing. Everyone who can defend their city must continue to fight. Must. Because if everyone leaves, then whose city will it be? We are doing everything - on our part - to make the agreement work. This is one of the main tasks for today. Let's see if we can go further. In the negotiation process. Let’s pray for our military. Let’s help our civilians. Let’s work for peace. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Great people of a great country! A country of power. A country of freedom. The people of absolute moral leadership. We have endured nine days of darkness. Nine days of evil. This is three times more than darkness and evil expected. We responded to the invasion as we can in times of greatest danger. Responded with heroism. Solidarity. Mutual assistance. We responded in Ukrainian. So that the history of Europe will remember it forever. It will tell children about it. Show it to grandchildren. The whole continent will know the city of Kharkiv. The city of Chernihiv. The city of Sumy. The city of Volnovakha. The city of Mariupol. The city of Mykolaiv. And many other of our beautiful cities. Living cities! Cities that have withstood the worst invasion since World War II. I say this specifically as a fait accompli. Withstood. No matter what the situation is at the moment, strategically, everything is clear. Ukrainians are united from Uzhhorod to Kharkiv, from Kyiv to Kherson. Ukrainians are chasing the enemy near Kyiv. They are beating him for Okhtyrka. Punishing him for Hostomel. They will take revenge for Kherson. Our Kherson! Ukrainian Kherson. Which they tried to humiliate today. They failed. They were not allowed. Ukrainians have shown themselves. They did not allow themselves to be deceived in a cheap cynical show. With a handout instead of help. With propaganda instead of sincerity. Russian propagandists thought of our people as of themselves. And they saw that Kherson residents are proud. And respect themselves. Respect Ukraine. I understand how difficult the decision is. When in the occupation they come out against armed enemies. I feel how risky it is. But I see how our people refuse to play by the rules of the invaders. How our people remain Ukrainians. How our people stay with our state, even temporarily finding themselves in the darkness. If Russian politicians still have their eyes, they will be able to see what Ukraine is. What our freedom is. The invaders thought they could turn off our television to Ukrainians. Our connection. They thought they could take away products, shut off the electricity. They thought it would force Ukrainians to submit. But even if you deprive us of oxygen, we will breathe deeply, to say: get out of our land! Even in complete darkness we see the truth. And we will fight until it darkens in our eyes. Because we are the warriors of light. And today no one on Earth will be able to say that this line is pathos. The 9th day of the war. Many of us have a tradition to remember those who are not with us on the 9th day. Eternal memory to everyone who died for Ukraine! Unfortunately, today there is a complete impression that it is time to give a funeral repast for something else: Security guarantees and promises. Determination of alliances. Values that seem to be dead for someone. The NATO summit took place today. Weak summit. Confused summit. Summit, which shows that not everyone considers the struggle for freedom to be Europe's number one goal. All NATO intelligence offices are well aware of the enemy's plans. They also confirmed that Russia wants to continue the offensive. As best it can. For 9 days we have seen a brutal war. They are destroying our cities. They are shelling our people, our children, and residential neighborhoods. Churches. Schools. They destroy everything that ensures a normal life. And they want to continue it. Knowing that new strikes and casualties are inevitable, NATO deliberately decided NOT to close the sky over Ukraine. We believe that NATO countries themselves have created a narrative that the closure of the sky over Ukraine would provoke Russia's direct aggression against NATO. This is self-hypnosis. Of those who are weak, underconfident. Internally. Although they may have weapons many times more powerful than ours. You had to think about people. About humanity itself. And what did you think about at that summit? All the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you. Because of your weakness. Because of your disunity. All the Alliance has managed to do so far is to carry fifty tons of diesel fuel for Ukraine through its procurement system. Probably so that we can burn the Budapest Memorandum. To make it burn better. But it is already burnt for us. In the fire of Russian troops. Is this NATO we wanted? Is this the Alliance you were building? Today, the Alliance's leadership gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities by refusing to make a no-fly zone. You could close our sky. But… I do not know who you can protect and whether you can protect NATO countries. You will not be able to buy us off with liters of fuel for liters of our blood. Shed for our common Europe. For our common freedom. For our common future. But I am also grateful to our country's friends in NATO. There are many countries of our friends, our partners - most of the powerful partners. Those who help our state no matter what. From the first day of the invasion. And I'm sure, until the victory. And that's why we do NOT feel alone. We continue to fight. We will protect our state. We will liberate our land. Thanks to our heroes. I awarded decorations and medals to 76 Ukrainian heroes for personal courage and selfless actions for our defense. Unfortunately, 37 of them are awarded posthumously. I awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to Lieutenant General Oleksandr Oleksiyovych Pavliuk, Commander of the Joint Forces Operation. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Volodymyr Vasyliovych Shvorak, Deputy Commander of the East Operational Command of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General of Justice on Colonel of Justice Serhiy Mykolayovych Melnyk, Head of the Military Law Institute of the Yaroslav the Wise National Law University. I conferred the military rank of Brigadier General on Colonel Artem Yevhenovych Bohomolov, Deputy Commander of the West Operational Command.

0,"People of Ukraine! We have survived the night that could have stopped history. History of Ukraine. History of Europe. Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The largest in Europe. It alone could be like six Chornobyls. Russian tankers knew what they were firing at. Direct aiming at the station. This is terror of an unprecedented level. There are 15 nuclear units in Ukraine. And the Russian servicemen have completely forgotten about Chornobyl. About this world tragedy. Russian people, I want to address you. How is that even possible? Together in 1986 we struggled with the consequences of the Chornobyl disaster. You must remember the burning graphite scattered by the explosion. Victims. You must remember the glow above the destroyed power unit. You must remember the evacuation from Pripyat and the 30 km zone. How could you forget it? And if you have not forgotten, then you cannot be silent. You must tell your authorities, go to the streets and say that you want to live. To live on earth without radioactive contamination. Radiation does not know where the border of Russia is. All night I was in touch with partners, with the leaders of other countries, so that the world could react. I felt that the world leaders were shocked. Britain is convening a UN Security Council over the attack. The IAEA is launching its 24-Hour Incident and Emergency Center. Immediate sanctions against the nuclear terrorist state are needed. Immediate closure of the sky over Ukraine is needed, because only this can guarantee that Russia will not strike at least missiles and air bombs at nuclear facilities. I am grateful to our heroes from the National Guard who guarded the station and tried to stop the enemy. I am grateful to the rescuers who extinguished the fire. But a lot depends on the common people of Energodar. You understand the threat to the station better than anyone else. You live there. Next to it. And you see the invaders directly. Drive them away. Let them know that Energodar is Ukraine. That Ukraine is not a place for nuclear ashes. Ukrainians! The enemy has brought the vast majority of its troops into the territory of our state. Almost the entire Russian army is thrown against our people. But the heroic resistance of Ukrainians has been saving our country from this invasion for the ninth day. Ukrainian cities have not seen such inhuman cruelty since the Nazi occupation. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Kharkiv, Mariupol. They are purposefully destroying civilian infrastructure. Destroying people. Residential neighborhoods. Just yesterday, Russian bombs killed 47 people in Chernihiv. Peaceful people. Kharkiv... Kharkiv is simply being destroyed by rocket artillery and air strikes. Russia. Destroys. Kharkiv. How could this happen? This morning in Zhytomyr, the rocket hit the school building. Hit children. This is the reality when “fraternal” Russia comes. Yesterday, during talks in Belarus, we managed to agree on the creation of humanitarian corridors where people suffer the most. Today we will see whether the agreement works. Our defense inflicts maximum losses on the enemy. Almost 9,200 invaders were killed. As of the morning of the ninth day of the war. We beat them near Mykolaiv. We beat them near Kharkiv. We beat them near Kyiv. The capital remains a key target for the invaders. But they will not break us, they will not break our statehood. Never. No matter what they do, they will still lose. Because we are at home. We are on our own land. They are constantly preparing provocations. A provocation is being prepared in Kherson. They are going to put up a performance of a kind of rally for Russia. To do this, they brought strangers to the city. They are looking for local traitors. They want to make a TV picture as if Kherson is no longer Ukrainian. I want to remind you that this is how they started the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LPR"". You understand what happened to them later. This must be stopped. Kherson residents, show that this is your city. You can stop everything, any plan of the invaders. Do not listen to anyone - listen to your children, listen to your heart. You are Ukrainians. I urge Kherson residents to get rid of any despair. Ukraine will not give up what is ours. We are fighting against a powerful enemy that outnumbers us. Which outnumbers us in the amount of equipment. But which is thousands of light years away from normal people who have dignity. Show it. Our national flag. Our national anthem. Our national spirit. Be sure to let the occupiers know that they can only be in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own Kherson. Like any other city in Ukraine. Let the occupiers know that they can only stay in Kherson temporarily. And they will never be able to own your city, Kherson. Like any other Ukrainian city - the city of our state. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Unbreakable people of invincible Ukraine! Exactly two years ago, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded in Ukraine. The first weeks of fighting it were extremely difficult. But we were united, and therefore strong, and therefore we withstood. Exactly a week ago, Ukraine was attacked by another virus. Another disease. By those who suffer from severe annexation and occupation of foreign lands. One week ago, at 4 am, Russia invaded our independent Ukraine, our land. Acute fit of aggression, megalomania, delusion of persecution. Heavy psychological complexes and as a result - missile systems. Rocket artillery. Tanks and other armored vehicles - simply like locusts. The first hours and days of full-scale war were extremely difficult. But we were united, and therefore strong, and therefore we withstood. And it will be so. And we will continue to stand. We stand so that the invaders were forced to change tactics. Russia's missile and bomb strikes at Ukrainian cities are a confession that they could not do anything significant on land. All lines of our defense are preserved. The enemy has no success in any of the strategic directions. They are demoralized. They are doomed. Kyiv survived this night and withstood another missile and bomb strike. Our air defense worked. Kherson, Izyum, all other cities where the invaders carried out strikes from the air, did not give up anything. Chernihiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv hold the line. Odesa. They also want to destroy Odesa. But they will see only the bottom of the Black Sea. The target of Russia was the Assumption Cathedral in Kharkiv. One of the oldest Orthodox monuments of the city, monuments of Ukraine. During the war, the cathedral is a shelter for Kharkiv residents. Shelter for all people: believers and non-believers. For everyone, because everyone is equal. Holy place. Now it is damaged by war. They are not afraid of even that! They enjoy the fact that God does not give an instant rebuff. But he sees. And he answers. Answers so that you cannot hide. There is no such bunker to survive God's response. And we will restore the cathedral so that no trace of war remains there. And even if you destroy all our cathedrals and churches, you will not destroy our sincere faith in God, in Ukraine. Faith in people. We will restore every house, every street, every city. And we say to Russia: learn the words ""reparations"" and ""contributions"". You will repay everything you did against Ukraine. In full. And we will not forget those who perished, and God won’t. You have come to destroy our cities. Destroy our people. Take away from us everything that is dear to us. You cut off electricity, water and heating to civilians in Ukraine. You leave people without food and medicine. You are shelling routes of possible evacuation. There is no weapon that you would not use against us, against the free citizens of Ukraine. And now you are telling your propagandists that you are going to send so-called humanitarian columns to Ukraine... Remember, godless men: when millions of people curse you, you have nothing to save yourself. Ukrainians in all war-torn regions will receive everything they need from us. Coordination headquarters are working in full. Real humanitarian goods are on the way. Our government has already prepared a program of special assistance for all Ukrainians who have lost the opportunity to work. Now. Because of the war. Where there is fighting! Every employee, every sole proprietor, every citizen of ours, from whom Russia has taken away the opportunity to work, will receive six and a half thousand hryvnias without any conditions. I especially emphasize this for older Ukrainians. Despite the war, we ensure full payment of pensions. Indexed pensions. As it should be in accordance with the law. From March 1, pensions for Ukrainians are indexed by 14%. The money has already gone to the banks. All payments will be made in full. Ukraine receives weapons from its partners on a daily basis. From real friends. More and more powerful weapons every day. Ukraine is already meeting foreign volunteers who are going to our country. The first of sixteen thousand. They are going to defend freedom. Defend life. For us. For all. And it will be successful. I'm sure. We have survived in our history and on our land two world wars, three Holodomors, the Holocaust, Babyn Yar, the Great Terror, the Chornobyl explosion, the occupation of Crimea and the war in the east. We do not have a huge territory - from ocean to ocean, we do not have nuclear weapons, we do not fill the world market with oil and gas. But we have our people and our land. And for us - it's gold. That is what we are fighting for. We have nothing to lose but our own freedom and dignity. For us, this is the greatest treasure. They wanted to destroy us so many times. They failed. They wanted to wipe us off the face of the earth. They failed. They backstabbed us. And we are on our feet. They wanted us to be silent. But the whole world heard us. We've been through so much! And if someone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians - all of us - are scared, broken or will surrender, he knows nothing about Ukraine. And he has nothing to do in Ukraine. Go home. To your home. Protect Russian-speaking people. Not all over the world. In your country. There are almost 150 million of them. And here... Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Good health to you, dear Ukrainians! Strong and kind! But – kind NOT to enemies. We are a nation that broke the enemy's plans in a week. Plans that have been built for years. Treacherously. Deliberately. With hatred of our country, of our people - of any people who have heart and freedom. But we stopped them. We beat them. Our military, border guards, territorial defense. Even ordinary farmers capture the Russian military on a daily basis. And they all say one thing: they don't know why they're here. Despite the fact that their quantity is ten times bigger, the morale of the enemy is deteriorating. More and more invaders are fleeing back to Russia. From us. From you. From all who drive out the enemy with javelins, stugnas, guns, tanks, planes, helicopters. Everything that shoots. But Ukrainians are beating the enemy even without weapons. I sincerely admire the heroic civilians of Konotop, Bashtanka, Energodar, Melitopol. Other towns and villages. Who do not let the invaders in by blocking the roads. People come out in front of enemy vehicles. This is extremely dangerous. But this is brave. It is also salvation. I'm sure you saw a video from Melitopol where Ukrainians protested against Russians who entered our city. Temporarily. I am sure of this: if they entered somewhere, it is only temporarily. We’ll drive them out. With shame. As those people, ordinary people who drive the invaders out of grocery stores when the Russian soldiers are trying to find food do. These are not warriors of the superpower. These are confused children who were used. Take them home. Ukrainians! Every invader should know: they will not get anything here. No one will be conquered. Even if they can accumulate more equipment and more people, it doesn't change anything for them. Wherever they enter. They will be destroyed everywhere. They will not have peace. They will have no food. They will not have a single quiet moment. The invaders will receive only a rebuff from Ukrainians. Fierce rebuff. Such a rebuff that they will forever remember that we will not give up what’s ours. That they will remember what the patriotic war is. Yes, for us it is a patriotic war. We remember how patriotic wars begin. And we know how they end. For the invaders. Our army is doing everything to break the enemy completely. Almost nine thousand Russians were killed! In one week! In the Mykolaiv direction invaders have to take away the ""two hundred"" and ""three hundred"" with tens of helicopters. 19 years, 20 years ... What did they see in life, apart from this invasion? But most of them remain everywhere. Ukraine does not want to be covered with military corpses. Go home. Your whole army. Tell your commanders that you want to live. Not to die. To live. The war must be stopped and peace restored as soon as possible. Today was, as usual, an active day of negotiations with the leaders of the member states of our anti-war coalition. I held talks with the heads of government of Norway and Israel. With the President of Kazakhstan. With the Emir of Qatar Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani. With President of the European Council Charles Michel. With Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. With President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Brilliant result at the UN General Assembly. 141 countries supported the resolution, which calls on Russia to withdraw troops from Ukraine immediately. 141 states stand for us! And for Russia - only four states that voted against. Here is the list: North Korea, Eritrea, Syria and Belarus. This is the list. These are the friends. And there will be no others for the state that does not know how to live in peace. Today I held a meeting with the heads of regions and cities of Ukraine. The new head of the Odesa regional state administration is already working. Maksym Marchenko. Military. Professional. Our guys on the ground are working hard to organize ""green corridors"". To take out civilians. To bring medicine. Volnovakha, cities of the Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv regions, south of Ukraine. This is very difficult. Extremely difficult. We are opposed by terror. But terror loses. Thanks to our heroes. Today I signed a decree awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to fifteen of our defenders: Senior Lieutenant Maksym Vitaliyovych Bilokon. Posthumously. He took part in repelling the enemy's attack during the defense of Chernihiv, destroyed the enemy's subversive group and two enemy tanks. Lieutenant Colonel Oleksandr Valeriyovych Kapichun.

0,"Good health to you, united country! I did not accidentally say ""united"". The seventh day of this terrible war began. A war we feel the same way. During this time we have had more unity than for over thirty years before. At first we were equally scared, then we felt equally painful. And now we do not care. Except for victory. Except for the truth. Except for peace. Except for the tranquility we want to achieve. Except for the lives of our people, for whom we are worried. Except for Ukraine. During this time, we have truly become one. We forgave each other a lot. We started loving each other. We help each other. We are worried for each other. Yesterday morning on Freedom Square we were all Kharkiv residents. Then the enemy destroyed us all by striking at residential buildings in Borodyanka. We were all bombed in Kyiv last night. And we all died again in Babyn Yar - from a missile strike. Although the whole world promises constantly - never again. For any normal person who knows history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv. A special part of Europe. A place of prayer. A place of remembrance for the hundred thousand people killed by the Nazis. The place of old Kyiv cemeteries. Who should you be to make it a target for missiles? You are killing Holocaust victims for the second time. During the Soviet era, a TV center was built on the bones there. And also a sports complex. Outbuildings. They built a park there. To erase the true history of Babyn Yar. But why was it bombed? This is beyond humanity. Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia, our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital. About our history. But they have an order to erase our history. Erase our country. Erase us all. On the first day of the war, Uman was brutally bombed, where hundreds of thousands of Jews come every year to pray. Then - Babyn Yar, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed. I am now addressing all the Jews of the world - don't you see what is happening? That is why it is very important that millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent right now. Nazism is born in silence. So shout about the killings of civilians. Shout about the killings of Ukrainians. Last night and tonight they continued to bomb our cities. Bombs. Missiles. Artillery. Machine guns. Targeting peaceful people. Again. Targeting residential areas. Again. Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr and other cities and towns of Ukraine. This cannot be explained by any human reason. Any reason of God. What then, if Babyn Yar was attacked? What other military facilities threaten Russia? What other “NATO bases”? Saint Sophia Cathedral? Lavra? St. Andrew's Church? Whatever they dream of there - damn them! Because God is with us! During this time, we have united the European Union already on a new level. Higher than formal. Higher than interstate. At the level of ordinary people. Millions and millions of Europeans. From the Atlantic Ocean to the suburbs of Kharkiv, where fierce fighting continues. When the European Parliament stood and applauded us, our struggle, it was an assessment of our efforts. Our unity. Six days of war like thirty years. That is why the European Union answers ""yes"" to us. We have started a special accelerated accession procedure. Our diplomats and our friends unite the world for the sake of Ukraine and peace even more. Neutral Switzerland has supported EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, officials, the state and companies. Once again: neutral Switzerland! So what do some other countries expect? Our anti-war coalition has already been joined by the countries that Moscow relied on a week ago. This is an extraordinary result. You can't stay neutral right now! And what is the result for Russia? The flag of this state will no longer be seen in sports tournaments. Modern world culture will now be closed to them. Russian goods are being removed from store shelves around the world. Russian banks are disconnected from the global system. Russian citizens are losing their savings, losing all prospects. Russian mothers are losing their children in a completely foreign country. Think of this number: almost six thousand Russians died. Russian military. In six days of war. This is without counting the losses of the enemy last night. Six thousand. To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible. This is not to be changed by missiles. Bombs. Tanks. Any blows. We are on our native land. And for the war against us there will be an International Tribunal for them. Ukrainians! Another night of Russia's full-scale war against us, against the people, has passed. Hard night. Someone spent that night in the subway - in a shelter. Someone spent it in the basement. Someone was luckier and slept at home. Others were sheltered by friends and relatives. We’ve hardly slept for seven nights. Or we sleep, but anxiously. My dears, the time will come when we will be able to sleep. But it will be after the war. After the victory. In a peaceful country, as we need. Which we have always appreciated. And which we have never destroyed. I ask all of you to take care of your loved ones. Take care of your brothers-in-arms. I admire you! The whole world admires you. From Hollywood stars to politicians. Today you, Ukrainians, are a symbol of invincibility. A symbol that people in any country can become the best people on earth at any moment. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Kharkiv. A cruise missile strike. At the largest square of Europe. Freedom Square. Dozens of victims. This is what the price of freedom is. This is what the morning of the people of Ukraine is. Ukrainian Kharkiv and Russian Belgorod have always been close cities. In many ways. Even the border between them was only conditional, only on maps, but not in the soul. Not in the soul. Now everything has changed. After the cruise missile that struck Kharkiv from Belgorod. The missile that hit Freedom Square. The face of our Kharkiv. This is terror against the city. There was no military target on the square. Just as in those residential areas of Kharkiv hit by rocket artillery. The rocket aimed at the central square is an outright, undisguised terror. No one will forgive. No one will forget. This attack on Kharkiv is a war crime. This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation. After that, Russia is a terrorist state. Obviously. And it must be official. We call on all countries of the world to respond immediately and effectively to this criminal tactic of the aggressor and to declare that Russia is committing state terrorism. We demand full responsibility for terrorists in international courts. Kharkiv and Kyiv are currently the most important targets for Russia. Terror is meant to break us. To break our resistance. They are heading to our capital, as well as to Kharkiv. Therefore, the defense of the capital today is the key priority for the state. All cities of Ukraine must do everything to stop the enemy. The military and civilian authorities of each city are responsible for this. But Kyiv is special. If we protect Kyiv, we will protect the state. This is the heart of our country. And it must keep beating. And it will keep beating. So that life triumphs. Dear Kyiv residents! Defense of the capital is above all. That's why I decided to appoint a professional military person as the Head of the Kyiv City Military Administration for the period of war. To guarantee the defense of the city. To block the enemy's approaches to our capital. To ensure that the people of Kyiv have everything they need. The Head of the Military Administration will be General Mykola Mykolayovych Zhyrnov, who served as commander of the support forces. At a high level he organized the engineering support of combat operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2014-2015. He is currently a state expert of the Military Security Service at the National Security and Defense Council. Vitali Klitschko remains mayor of Kyiv. He will have his own sphere of responsibility. And now it is a joint work of the mayor and the Head of the Military Administration. After the war, we will return everything to its place in the capital. Regarding our diplomats. Right now, our diplomats are implementing fair and absolutely necessary decisions in relation to those states that have betrayed their word and international law. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Kyrgyzstan for consultations. For justifying aggression against Ukraine. We immediately recall the Ambassador from Georgia. For the obstacles to volunteers who want to help us. For an immoral attitude towards sanctions. And now I want to speak about those whose feat is an example of the highest moral strength. These are our doctors. You save people around the clock. Always. And now your work is one of the key lines of our defense. You keep it brilliant. Thousands of lives have been saved in 5 days. I am also grateful to everyone who provides our people with everything they need for life in these extremely difficult conditions. Food, energy, medicine. And I thank the ordinary people of Ukraine, who stop tanks with their bare hands, expel the invaders from administrative buildings by force of spirit and make their stay in Ukraine shameful. To prove that they are all strangers here. This is what the people's war is. This is what the people of Ukraine is. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Russian forces today brutally shelled Kharkiv with rocket artillery. This is definitely a military crime. A peaceful city. Peaceful residential areas. No military object. Dozens of eyewitness records prove that this is not a separate false shot, it is a conscious destruction of people. Russians knew where they were shooting. For this crime there will definitely be a tribunal. International. This is a breach of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you the murder of peaceful Ukrainian people. Here is Ukraine. Here is Europe. Here is 2022. Evil, armed with rockets, bombs and artillery, must be stopped immediately. Destroyed economically. We must show that humanity is able to protect themselves. I believe that it is necessary to consider the full closure of the sky for Russian missiles, airplanes, helicopters. In five days of invasion, already 56 missile strikes have been carried out against Ukraine. 113 cruise missiles were fired. This is their ""fraternal friendship"". And the world knows what to do. I spoke about this with partners today. The state committing military crimes against civilians cannot be a member of the UN Security Council. The entrance to all ports, channels, airports in the world must be closed for this state . Such a state must not receive hundreds of billions for energy exports. Buying Russian goods now is to pay money for murdering people. Peaceful, proud, strong Kharkiv. You have always been such. You will always be such. We will withstand this as well. We will defend Ukraine. We will help everyone affected by inhuman invasion. Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Sumy, Hostomel, Vasylkiv, Kherson, Mariupol, Donetsk and all other cities and towns of our native country will see a peaceful and safe life. Sincere condolences to all who lost their relatives and loved ones in this war. Eternal memory to those who died. Eternal glory to everyone who defends our freedom! Before addressing you, I signed a decree on awarding the title of the Hero of Ukraine to twelve our defenders: Now about Kyiv, our beautiful capital, the basis of our state, our security. For an enemy, Kyiv is the key target. They want to break our national statehood. Therefore, the capital is constantly in danger. Three rocket-bombing strikes are carried out only today. TETs-6 is the target. They want to damage a power station and leave our city without light. We did not allow them to break the defense of the capital. And they send saboteurs to us. Constantly. Hundreds. All they are being neutralized. In addition to defense, we are thinking about the rear as well. Provide people with everything necessary. We formed a round-the-clock coordination headquarters that collects all requests from regional administrations regarding the lack of the most necessary stuff. Products, medicines, fuel, equipment. The headquarters directly  finds suppliers that can quickly and qualitatively meet such needs. This is the restoration of supply chains, interrupted by the war. Today, at the initiative of the Russian side, the first round of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia took place. These negotiations took place against the background of bombing and shelling of our territory, our cities. Synchronization of shelling with a negotiation process could be seen. I believe that Russia is trying to put pressure on us in such a way. Don't waste time. We do not perceive such tactics. Fair negotiations are possible when one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery precisely at the moment of negotiations. So far we do not have the result we would like to get. Russia has declared its position. We have outlined positions in response - to end the war. Some signals we received. When the delegation returns to Kyiv, we will analyze what we’ve heard and then determine how to move to the second round of negotiations. Another thing that is very important to say. We've been waiting 30 years for this. Today I signed an application for Ukraine's membership in the European Union. We have gained the right to be together with everyone in Europe. The application has already been delivered to Brussels, officially registered. The time has come. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Good morning, Ukrainian heroes! The fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against the people of Ukraine. We stand firm. During this time, we have experienced as much as other nations may not have in decades. We have been told for a long time that there is something wrong with Ukrainians in this or that issue. That Ukrainians have to do so-called ""homework"" for decades. Because of this, we often did not notice what we are really capable of. And now we have shown ourselves to the fullest. And it's inspiring. For everyone. In every conversation with our partners, I hear sincere respect. Ukrainians have shown the world who we are. And Russia has shown what it has become. Just think about it: during the Russian invasion - in just four days - sixteen Ukrainian children died as a result of the Russian shelling. Sixteen! 45 children were wounded. Every crime, every shelling that the invaders commit against us, unites us and our partners even more. Russia did not believe in such a solidary and powerful reaction. But Ukrainians have changed that story. The European Union has decided to supply us with weapons. We are grateful. Yesterday I spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, about further, even stronger steps. Europeans are aware that our soldiers are fighting for our country and, consequently, for the whole of Europe. For peace for all European countries, for the lives of children, for equality, for democracy. And this gives us the full right to do the following. We appeal to the European Union for Ukraine's immediate accession under a new special procedure. We are grateful to our partners for being with us. But our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I am confident that is fair. I am confident we deserve it. I am confident that all this is possible. Yesterday I spoke with the Presidents of Portugal, Lithuania, President of France Emmanuel Macron and President of Poland Andrzej Duda. I am especially grateful to Andrzej Duda for our fruitful work. I spoke with the Prime Ministers of Belgium, Spain and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson. Support of our anti-war coalition is unconditional and unprecedented. Europe has closed the sky to all Russian planes. Global business refuses any ties with Russian companies. Let's see how this week will end for the Russian currency - what will be the fall of the ruble. As long as this criminal invasion of Ukraine continues, the Russian state is suffering losses as if the war passed through their territory. Do you need all this? Russian mothers, Russian teachers, Russian entrepreneurs, ordinary people. For what? Four and a half thousand Russian soldiers have already been killed. Why did you all come here? Why do the columns of your armored vehicles go against us? From our Crimea. From Yalta, Yevpatoriya, Sudak, Simferopol... These are not the names of military camps for tankers. Once again: four and a half thousand Russian invaders killed. Throw away your equipment. And leave. Do not believe your commanders. Do not believe your propagandists. Just save your lives. Leave. We dedicate every hour to strengthening our state. Anyone who can join the fight against the invaders must do so. Therefore, a decision was made - not easy from a moral point of view, but useful from the point of view of our protection. Under martial law, participants in hostilities - Ukrainians with real combat experience - will be released from custody and will be able to compensate for their guilt in the hottest spots of war. All sanctions are lifted from some people who took part in the anti-terrorist operation. The key now is defense. When I ran for presidency, I said that each of us is the President. Because we are all responsible for our state. For our beautiful Ukraine. And now it turns out that each of us is a warrior. The warrior in his or her own place. And I am confident that each of us will win. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"I had a phone conversation with Alexander Lukashenko. We haven't spoken to him in two years. And today I had a long substantive conversation with him. I explained to him in detail the impossibility of our clash. I do not want missiles, planes, helicopters to fly to Ukraine from Belarus. I do not want troops to go to Ukraine from Belarus. And he assured me of that. My task as President is to protect our state. And you have seen during these tough days how we are fulfilling this task. Alexander Lukashenko called on the meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the Pripyat River. I emphasize: without any conditions. I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as President, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance. And while our guys are there, the President is here, the Head of the Office is here, the Prime Minister is here, the army is here, the Commander-in-Chief is here. We will all defend our state and our borders. You and I must act pragmatically to achieve our goal. And our goal is our territorial integrity. You have seen our position one hundred percent. This is the unconditional protection of national statehood. As regards our motivation. It is obvious that our servicemen are fighting not for money, but for today, for tomorrow. And they provide a very tough response to what happened yesterday. But we must understand that today the most important job is to be a soldier, to defend the country. And that's why I really want the state to pay decently for this job. We will pay our armed servicemen a hundred thousand hryvnias a month. Not to hear ""thank you"" from them, but to let them know that the country is definitely grateful to them. And it will be so until this war is over. Glory to Ukraine!

They are going to bomb our Ukrainian cities even more. They are going to kill our children even more insidiously. This is an evil that has come to our land and must be destroyed. They lied that they would not touch the civilian population. But since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure. They consciously chose tactics to destroy people and everything that makes life just normal. Power plants, hospitals, kindergartens, residential buildings - all this is under attack every day. What the invaders are doing to Kharkiv, Okhtyrka, Kyiv, Odesa and other cities and towns deserves an international tribunal. We clearly record all their crimes. And there would have been many more of these crimes if it hadn't been for our courageous defenders. Ukrainian forces are great. Repulse attacks, breaking the enemy's plans. They do their job brilliantly. Yes, this is truly a job. A hard, fundamental, and most importantly - fair job. A job that deserves the highest appraisal and the highest gratitude. A decision was made to significantly increase the payments to our defenders. I can honestly say that it will be expensive. But there is nothing more precious than life and the struggle for our freedom and freedom of our next generations. And there are those who will help us. This is already real. We get weapons, medicine, food, diesel, money. A strong international coalition in support of Ukraine has been formed. An anti-war coalition. Here is the latest summary from the diplomatic frontline. There were very substantive talks with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the President of Georgia, the Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Johnson. Each conversation added specifics to the defense capabilities of our state and the strength of our military. Germany has announced the supply of 1,000 anti-tank grenade launchers and 500 Stingers with additional ammunition. Belgium provides 5,000 machine guns and 5 million rounds of ammunition, and another 4,000 tons of fuel. Thanks to active diplomacy, we’ve convinced all European countries to disconnect Russia from SWIFT. We thank President of Poland Andrzej Duda for his personal leadership in granting Ukraine membership in the European Union. Poland's daily assistance to our country is also very much needed. We have to call a spade a spade. Russia's criminal actions against Ukraine show signs of genocide. I talked about this with the UN Secretary General. Russia is on the path of evil.

0,"These words of mine will be addressed to the citizens of Belarus. Today, all of you are called to the polls to vote in the referendum. This could look like a normal political process. But now it certainly cannot be anything normal. Now decisions are made on a completely different level. Last night in Ukraine was cruel. More shelling. More bombing of residential areas, civilian infrastructure. Today there is not a single object in the country that the invaders would not consider a valid target for themselves. They fight against everyone. They fight against everything that’s alive - against kindergartens, against residential buildings and even against ambulances. They use rocket artillery, missiles against entire urban areas in which there has never been any military infrastructure. Vasylkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and many other cities of Ukraine are surviving in conditions that were last seen on our land and your land during the Second World War. But in the war that is going on now, you are not on the same side with us. Regretfully. From your territory, the troops of the Russian Federation launch rockets into Ukraine. Our children are being killed from your territory, our houses are being destroyed, they are trying to blow up everything that has been built over decades - and, by the way, not only by us, but also by our fathers, our grandfathers. And all this is also a de facto referendum for you, Belarusians. You decide who you are. You decide who to be. How will you look into the eyes of your children, how will you look into the eyes of each other, your neighbors. And we are your neighbors. We, Ukrainians. Be Belarus, not Russia! You are making this choice right now. Exactly today. Now there is a lot of news about possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, which can end this war and restore peace to all of us. And they often mention your capital. Minsk. As a platform for these negotiations. A place we didn't choose. And, in fact, you did not, too.The leadership of Russia chose it. And now, there is an offer to meet there again. Four days ago, cruise missiles, planes, helicopters and equipment came from Belarusian territory. They hit our homes, they hit our lives. The heavy equipment followed. And this is a dreadful deja vu. You know, Kyiv was attacked at 4 am. Someone has such a sense of humor, just as in 1941. You slept, Belarusian brothers. And we woke up. But you are still sleeping. And we haven't gone to bed since that moment. Because we are fighting. We are fighting for our country. We are fighting for our freedom. Because we have every right to do so. If there were no aggressive actions from your territory, we could speak in Minsk. In your city. When you were neutral, we spoke in Minsk, we met many times. This is right. This is truthful. To talk like neighbors. Right now, you haven't made your big choice yet. And it is ahead, it should depend only on you. Not on Russia, not on Ukraine, not on America, but on the people of Belarus. That is why now we say - not Minsk. The venue for the meeting may be other cities. Of course, we want peace. We want to meet, we want the end of the war! Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku - we proposed to the Russian side all of this. Any other city suits us in a country from whose territory missiles are not launched. Only in this way can negotiations be honest. And they can really end the war. I sincerely wish Belarus to once again become that kind, safe Belarus that everyone saw not so long ago. Make the right choice. I am sure this is the main choice of your great people.

0,"I can start this address with good news. We withstood and successfully repel enemy attacks. The fighting continues. In many cities and districts of our state. But we know what we are defending. The country, the land, the future of children. Kyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. The invaders wanted to block the center of our state and put their puppets here, as in Donetsk. We broke their plan. They did not gain any advantage over us. On our streets, in the skies of Kyiv, in Vasylkiv, in Vyshhorod, even in the surrounding fields, a real battle for Kyiv took place. The enemy used everything against us: missiles, fighter aircraft, drones, artillery, armored vehicles, saboteurs, paratroopers. The invaders are shelling residential neighborhoods, including with the use of missile artillery, trying to destroy energy facilities. They have very treacherous tactics. Dwellings destroyed by missiles and artillery are the ultimate argument for the world to stop the occupation invasion together with us. I say this as frankly as possible now: the people of Ukraine have already earned and have the right to become a member of the European Union. This will be the key evidence of our country's support. It is a crucial moment to close the long-standing strategic discussion once and for all and to decide on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. I discussed this today with Charles Michel, Ursula von der Leyen, Emmanuel Macron. The anti-war coalition is operating - defense weapons and equipment are heading to Ukraine. We already have almost full support from EU countries for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT. I hope that Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision. We have the courage to defend our homeland, to defend Europe. In each of our cities, the invaders are being severely rebuffed. Uman, Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donbas, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv - wherever the enemy kills our people, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to stop and destroy the invaders. Lviv and other cities in western and central Ukraine that are under air attacks endure firmly. Well done! Every Ukrainian needs to remember one thing. If you can stop and destroy the invaders, do it. All those who can return to Ukraine, come back to defend Ukraine. And then we will have a lot of work with you to rebuild it! All those who can defend Ukraine abroad, do it purposefully, unitedly, continuously! All friends of Ukraine who want to join the defense - come, we will give you weapons! All the details of how to implement this will be announced in the near future. Glory to all those who defend Ukraine today! You are heroes! I adopted a decision to posthumously award the title of Hero of Ukraine to Vitaliy Volodymyrovych Skakun, a sapper of the 35th Separate Marine Brigade. At the cost of his own life, he blew up the bridge. And now I want absolutely everyone in Russia to hear me. Thousands of victims. Hundreds of prisoners who simply cannot understand why they were sent to Ukraine. Sent to be killed. The sooner you tell your government that the war must be stopped immediately, the more of your people will remain alive. We see that there are indeed protests by your citizens against the war. We know that many in Russia are now simply shocked by the meanness and cruelty of the authorities. This is a truly correct response. I thank you for this reaction. Thanks to Leonid Parfyonov, Dmitry Muratov, Yury Dud, Liya Akhedzhakova, Valery Meladze and thousands, thousands of other Russians whose conscience is heard loud. Just stop those who lie to you, lie to us, lie to the whole world. We need to end this war. We can live in peace - in global peace, in human peace.

0,"I was really glad to see the news from friendly Georgia. I want to thank the good, beautiful Georgian people who went out on the streets of their country and supported Ukraine. You are true friends! Thanks. Our main goal is to end this slaughter. The enemy suffers very-very serious losses. These are hundreds, hundreds of killed soldiers who crossed our border, who came to our land. We suffer losses as well, unfortunately. Ukrainians resist the aggression heroically. It is impossible to justify. Therefore, the invaders have to come up with more and more absurd accusations to say at least something. I am convinced that these allegations are biased, nobody will believe them. Ukrainians won’t believe them, the world won’t believe them, citizens of the Russian Federation won’t believe them. It's simply cannot be such a truth that could clarify why kindergartens and housing infrastructure are fired from a missile artillery. In Vorzel, Kyiv region, they fired ""Grads"" at an orphanage. Okhtyrka, Sumy region, was shelled by ""Uragans"". Housing quarters, shelter, kindergartens were under the shelling. What is this war against Ukrainian children in a kindergarten? Who are they? Are they neo-Nazis from kindergarten as well? Or were they NATO soldiers that threatened Russia? Killed and injured children are the sentence to this invasion. Everyone, I emphasize, everyone must do everything they can to stop this war. Every day of aggression destroys normal life not only in Ukraine, but also in Russia, and in Europe, in the world. Europeans do not imagine yet what it is like to live when there is such a confrontation next to you. I have to say absolutely frankly: this night will be harder than a day. Many cities of our state are under attack. Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys, our girls in Donbas, cities of the south of Ukraine. Kyiv requires special attention. We cannot lose the capital. I appeal to our defenders on all frontlines. This night the enemy will use all the forces available to break our resistance. Treacherously, viciously, inhumanly. This night they will make an assault upon us. We all have to understand what we are going to face. This night we have to withstand. The fate of Ukraine is now being decided. Each civilian should be as careful as possible. Help, please, each other, especially elderly people, lonely, those for whom it is very difficult now. In case of any danger go to the shelter. Everyone who has already joined the country's defense or can help defend, stop the enemy everywhere you can. Remove special signs that saboteurs leave on the roads and buildings. Burn the enemy’s equipment with anything you can. If even kindergartens are a permissible target for invaders, you must not leave them any chance. All thoughts, all prayers of Ukrainians are with our military. We believe in them, take care of them. Defend our state. The night will be tough, very tough. But the morning will come.

0,"Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz yesterday said Russia's invasion of Ukraine is something Europe has not seen for 75 years. And it's true. But this is not the whole truth. This is not just Russia's invasion in Ukraine, this is the beginning of the war against Europe. Against the unity of Europe. Against elementary human rights in Europe. Against all coexistence rules on the continent. Against the fact that European states refuse to divide, yes, to divide the borders by force. The cities of Ukraine undergo rocket bombing for the second day already. Tank columns and air strikes are as similar as something Europe has already seen a long time ago - during the Second World War and talked ""never again"" about it. But this is it! Again. Now. In 2022. 75 years after the Second World War completion. I’m confident you see it - all of you, entire Europe. But we do not see in full what you are going to do. How are you going to protect yourself when you help us so slowly in Ukraine? I’d like to point out what has already happened. And for this we are grateful. Sectoral sanctions. The United States, Canada, United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand introduced precisely sectoral sanctions against Russia. In particular, against all the largest banks. Against the largest Russian enterprises. Against Russia's access to Western technologies. But Russian tanks are still shooting at residential buildings in our cities. Armored vehicles are still attacking, including civilians. Ordinary citizens of Ukraine. Europe has sufficient force to stop this aggression. What to expect from European states further? Cancellation of visas for Russians? Cutting off Swift? Full isolation of Russia? Recalling ambassadors? Oil embargo? Closure of the sky? Today, all this should be on the table, because it is a threat to us, all of us, all of Europe. You can still stop aggression. We must act without delay. Ordinary people can also do their part of the job, I'm sure, in every country of the world, in each country of Europe. Go out on the square of your cities and demand peace for Europe, peace for Ukraine, stop this war. Go out, go out on the squares and demand to stop the war. This is our right. This is your right. When bombs fall in Kyiv, this happens in Europe, not only in Ukraine. When missiles kill our people, it's the death of all Europeans. Require more protection for Europe, more protection for Ukraine - as part of a democratic world. While state institutions in Europe are in no hurry with really strong decisions, every European in the capital can already come to our embassy and offer assistance. Demand from your governments more financial, more military assistance to Ukraine. For this help is a help to you. For it is a help to Europe. You help yourself. If you have a combat experience in Europe and do not want to look at the indecision of politicians, you can arrive in our state and protect Europe with us where it is now urgently required. You have already been blackmailed with gas. Already humiliated. They already want to split and divide you the same way as they are trying to divide Ukraine today. Protect yourself. Just as we protect yourself. I want to address Russian Federation President once again. Battles take place all over the territory of Ukraine. Let's sit at the negotiating table. To stop the death of people. And now I want to address the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Stand firmly. You are all we have. You are everything that protects our state. Glory to Ukraine!

0,"The second morning of a large-scale war. At 4 am, Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. This is a lie. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas to operate. Just as yesterday, the military and civilians are equally under Russian attack. The purpose of this attack is to put pressure on you, the citizens of Ukraine, to put pressure on our entire society. I emphasize: not just on the government - on all Ukrainians. And today - even more than yesterday. Our men and women - all defenders of Ukraine - did not allow the enemy to realize the operational plan of invasion on the first day. Ukrainians demonstrate real heroism. The enemy was stopped in most directions. There are fights. Therefore, Russia's attack continues with the expectation that our forces will be tired. But no one is tired. Ukraine's air defense forces are protecting our sky. As much as possible. Enemy aircraft operate treacherously over residential areas, including the capital. Terrible explosions in the morning sky over Kyiv, bombing, hitting a house, fire - all this reminds of the first such attack on our capital, which took place in 1941. This morning we are defending our state alone, as we did yesterday. The world's most powerful forces are watching from afar. Did yesterday's sanctions convince Russia? We hear in our sky and see on our earth that this is not enough. Foreign troops are still trying to become more active in our territory. Only the solidarity and determination of Ukrainians can preserve our freedom and protect the state. The army, border guards, the National Guard, the police, intelligence, the Territorial Defense Forces - everyone performs their tasks to the maximum. It is very important that today our citizens also demonstrate maximum endurance and mutual support. Take care of your family and loved ones, but do not forget about the people around you. Those who are single, those who are older. Help them with food. Help find shelter when there is an air alarm. Help with access to verified official information. Stop the enemy wherever you see it. The fate of Ukraine depends only on Ukrainians. No one but ourselves will control our lives. We are on our land, the truth is on our side. It will not be possible to destroy our character. Kalibr missiles are helpless against our freedom. Russia will still have to talk to us sooner or later. Talk about how to end the fighting and stop this invasion. The sooner the conversation begins, the smaller Russia's losses will be. Dear citizens of the Russian Federation. As I said, tonight they started bombing residential areas of the hero city of Kyiv. It all reminds me of 1941. To all the citizens of the Russian Federation who come out to protest, I want to say - we see you. This means that you heard us. This means that you begin to trust us. Fight for us. Fight against the war. Dear citizens of Ukraine. We are defending ourselves! We do not stop! Glory to you! Glory to our army! Glory to Ukraine!

0,"Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Men and women, our defenders! You are brilliantly defending the country from one of the most powerful countries in the world. Today Russia attacked the entire territory of our state. And today our defenders have done a lot. They defended almost the entire territory of Ukraine, which suffered direct blows. They regain the one that the enemy managed to occupy. For example, Hostomel near Kyiv. This gives more confidence to the capital. According to preliminary data, unfortunately, we have lost 137 of our heroes today - our citizens. 10 of them are officers. 316 are wounded. On our Zmiinyi Island, defending it to the last, all the border guards died heroically. But did not give up. All of them will be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. May the memory of those who gave their lives for Ukraine live forever. I am grateful to everyone who saves people right now and helps maintain order in the state. The enemy strikes not only at military facilities, as it claims, but also at civilians. They kill people and turn peaceful cities into military targets. This is vile and will never be forgiven. I know that a lot of fakes are being produced now. In particular, that I allegedly left Kyiv. I stay in the capital, I stay with my people. During the day, I held dozens of international talks, directly managed our country. And I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine. My children are also in Ukraine. My family is not traitors. They are the citizens of Ukraine. But I have no right to say where they are now. According to our information, the enemy marked me as the number one target. My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the Head of State. We also have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv. That's why I am asking Kyivites very much: be careful, follow the rules of curfew. I remain in the government quarter together with all those who are necessary for the work of the central government. No matter how many conversations I had with the leaders of different countries today, I heard a few things. The first is that we are supported. And I am grateful to each state that helps Ukraine concretely, not just in words. But there is another - we are left alone in defense of our state. Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly - I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid. Today we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status. I tell all the partners of our state: now is an important moment - the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance. Today, I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer. And we are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our state. We are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk to Russia. We are not afraid to say everything about security guarantees for our state. We are not afraid to talk about neutral status. We are not in NATO now. But the main thing - what security guarantees will we have? And what specific countries will give them? We need to talk about the end of this invasion. We need to talk about a ceasefire. But now the fate of the country depends entirely on our army, on our heroes, our security forces, all our defenders. And on our people, your wisdom and the great support of all friends of our country. Glory to Ukraine!
